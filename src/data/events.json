    "title": "RS Cosmology Meets Condensed Matter",
    "description": "By Professor Tom Kibble FRS and Professor George Pickett FRS\n\nThe meeting aims to bring together physicists from the very different disciplines of condensed matter physics and cosmology/astrophysics to exploit the remarkable correspondences emerging between processes and mechanisms on hugely different scales. Motion in a condensate mimics motion in a curved space-time metric; quantized vortices mimic cosmic strings; coherent phase boundaries mimic branes; there are partial analogues of black holes and some features of neutron stars. Condensed matter processes in the laboratory can provide insight into inaccessible cosmological processes and the violent transitions in the early Universe have in turn generated interest into rapid transits of analogous phase transitions in condensed matter.\n\nInvited speakers include: Professor James Anglin, Dr Yuriy Bunkov, Professor Anne Davis, Dr Richard Haley, Professor Matti Krusius, Dr Ulf Leonhardt, Professor Ray Rivers, Professor Joseph Polchinski, Dr Emil Polturak, Dr Ralf Schützhold, Dr William Unruh, Dr Mairi Sekellariadou, Professor Tanmay Vachaspati, Professor Joe Vinen, Professor Grigoriy Volovik and Dr Wojciech Zurek\n\nEmail; discussion.meetings@royalsoc.ac.uk\n",

    "title": "Astronet Infrastructure Roadmap Symposium",
    "description": "This symposium, to be held in Liverpool on 16-19 June 2008, is being\norganised as part of a wide consultation process, which started with the\nconstitution of five thematic Panels and a Working Group drawn from the\nastronomical community. Since March 2007, this team of experts has been\npreparing a comprehensive, prioritised, pan-European plan, detailing those\nfacilities that will be necessary to deliver the ASTRONET Science Vision,\nand addressing also other important aspects such as education, training and\npublic awareness.\n\nThe following five sub-panels were charged by the ASTRONET board to address\nspecific areas of infrastructure:\n\n* Panel A: High energy astrophysics, astroparticle physics and gravitational\nwaves\n\n* Panel B: UVOIR and radio/mm, including survey instruments\n\n* Panel C: Solar telescopes, \"in situ\" (solar system) missions, laboratory\nstudies\n\n* Panel D: Theory, computing facilities and networks, Virtual Observatory\n\n* Panel E: Education, recruitment and training, public outreach\n\nThe Infrastructure Roadmap Working Group (IRWG) is responsible for\nsynthesising the conclusions of the Panels into one overarching Roadmap\ndocument, and is composed of the chairs and co-chairs of the panels and\nseveral members at large. Full membership of the IRWG and the panels is\navailable at http://www.astronet-eu.org/-Infrastructure-Roadmap-.\n\nThe first draft roadmap document will be widely distributed to the European\nastronomical community at large ahead of the Symposium, and a web-based\ndiscussion forum will be opened in parallel to give everyone the opportunity\nto express their views.\n\nAfter this stage, the Liverpool Symposium will provide a live forum for the\ncommunity to debate the draft recommendations formulated by the IRWG. Ample\ntime for discussion is foreseen, in the form of both plenary and\nspecialised, parallel sessions where the individual projects may be\npresented and the conclusions of each panel will be debated.\n\nAfter the Symposium, the IRWG will consider the outcomes of this wide\nconsultation process to formulate the final roadmap that will be publicly\nreleased in the Autumn of 2008.\n\nWe urge you to take part in these discussions, for your contribution is\nessential. All of the European astronomical community is invited to\nparticipate, including observers, theorists, instrument developers and\nengineers, educators and communicators.\n\nSpecific information about the Symposium, including a very preliminary\nprogramme, is available at http://www.astro.livjm.ac.uk/~airs2008. The\nregistration will open in early 2008, meanwhile you will be able to register\nyour interest and sign up for an email alert. Please note that there will be no\nregistration fee.\n",

The workshop is a full day and includes a series of keynote speakers and breakout sessions.  The workshop is organised by Intellect, UKspace and the Digital Systems KTN Location and Timing Programme.\n\nWhat's being talked about?\n\nThe event will be used to generate evidence to support the UK Space Innovation and Growth Strategy (Space IGS) which provided a recommendation that the Technology Strategy Board and the Regional Development Agencies explore the establishment of a GNSS applications test bed as a focus for the development of downstream products and services.  The test bed will enable UK-based companies develop a first mover advantage from using existing GNSS signals as well as early Galileo signals which are due to come online in 2010. \n\nhttp://www.intellectuk.org/component/option,com_events/Itemid,141/task,view_detail/agid,1627",

The UK Space Agency is responsible for all strategic decisions on the UK civil space programme and provides a clear, single voice for UK space ambitions. Crucially the UK Space Agency will negotiate on the UK’s behalf on international bodies such as the European Space Agency (ESA). Dr Williams takes over as Chairman of the ESA Council at a critical time in that Agency’s 35 year lifetime. The Ariane launcher and the International Space Station have both reached maturity but the future is unclear for both. ESA is increasingly the space agency of the European Union, complicating the relationship with Member States and with industry, and providing a backdrop to ESA’s increasing involvement in programmes with a security dimension.

Space and satellite technologies underpin many of today’s major commercial sectors; they provide essential information to understand our planet’s environment, changing climate and weather; enable great strides to be made in the scientific understanding of our Solar System and beyond; and they provide innovative tools for enhancing our quality of life.\n\nThe space and satellite industry is one of the UK’s unsung success stories. It supports 68,000 jobs in the UK directly and indirectly and contributes £6bn to the economy. This hi-tech, high-skilled sector underpins the high speed broadband, high definition television, GPS and weather forecasting that the modern world relies on.",

Various explosive cosmic events result from binary stars, as do close double black holes/neutron stars/white dwarfs, type Ia supernovae, X-ray binaries, millisecond pulsars etc. Relying on existing large scientific facilities, classical optical, radio and X-ray observations are discovering increasingly large numbers of such binary stars. A decade ago, the ground-based LIGO/Virgo detected the merging of two stellar-mass binary black holes, opening a new window in gravitational wave astronomy. In the future, with the support of next-generation astronomical instruments, we shall discover many more binary-related celestial objects. Against this backdrop, we convene this conference, inviting all international observers and theoreticians in the field of stellar science to participate in and exchange recent progress related to binary stars and to look forward to future collaboration and development of new directions for research. \nConference topics:\n\nBinary star interactions: from mass transfer to common envelope evolution.\nSupernovae: from progenitor modeling to explosion simulation.\nGravitational wave sources: from double black holes to white dwarfs.\nExotic stars: X-ray binaries, binary pulsars, luminous red novae, hot subdwarfs, cataclysmic variables, symbiotic stars, etc.\nBinary population synthesis studies on binary objects.\nBinary star observations from large facilities: Gaia, TESS, LAMOST, JWST, FAST, etc.\n\nExplore the Wonders of Lijiang and Beyond\nAs we eagerly await your arrival for the conference of “Binary Stars in a New Era”, it is our great pleasure to extend a heartfelt invitation for you to discover the beautiful city of Lijiang.

    "title": "IAU Symposium 402: Massive Stars Across Redshifts",
    "description": "IAU Symposium 402: Massive Stars Across Redshifts in the Era of JWST and Large-Scale Surveys \nScientific Motivation\nAlthough massive stars are crucial in solving the cosmic puzzle as they are key contributors of ionizing radiation, metals, cosmic rays and dust and, when they die, of neutron stars, black holes, and gravitational waves, many competing factors, are thought to influence their observed properties and challenge our understanding of how these stars evolve and contribute to the Universe. \nThe Massive Stars Commission (G2) of the IAU’s Stars and Stellar Physics Division regularly organizes a symposium, typically every 4 years, to present the latest research findings in the field, discuss the status of current research in massive stars, and chart the way forward for future research. The first meeting was in Argentina in 1971, and in the last decade we organized “Massive Stars: from Alpha to Omega” in Greece (2013), “IAUS 329: The Lives and Death Throes of Massive Stars” in New Zealand (2016), and “IAUS 361: Massive Stars Near and Far” in Ireland (2020, postponed to 2022 due to the pandemic). \nSince the last symposium organized by the G2 commission (IAUS 361, 2022), the James Webb Space Telescope is dramatically changing our understanding of the early Universe. Important discoveries at high redshift have been made, including galaxies that are too massive for their age, systems with oxygen abundances typical of much later epochs of the Universe, and possible signatures of Pop III stars at z=10. Massive stars, through population synthesis codes,\nare critical to simulate the evolution and early chemical enrichment of galaxies in the infant Universe, and to analyse the observed spectra of these very high redshift systems. \nMany improvements have been made on individual stars, close binaries and population synthesis models. \nA better understanding of the impact of massive stars on their surroundings has been achieved and, in addition, analysis techniques are also increasingly sophisticated. These involve accounting for improved or more complete physics, better atomic data, and/or evolving from 1-dimensional to 3D models in the simulations of stellar structure and winds. \nDespite the large progress, however, outstanding open questions on massive star evolution and winds remain (e.g. the role of metallicity, true mass loss rates, internal transport mechanisms and magnetic fields to name a few). The view of massive star evolution also needs to be reconciled with the view of the massive star graveyard drawn by gravitational wave experiments. These issues, to be discussed in this symposium, need to be solved to properly account for the role of massive stars across cosmic time, and to maximize the return of empirical datasets and models in the era of JWST and large surveys (SDSS V Mappers, SKA, and Rubin/LSST, among others). \nFortunately, the field of massive stars is entering a new era also enabled by large scale spectroscopic surveys. By targeting vast samples of massive stars in the Milky Way and our neighbours the Magellanic Clouds, IACOB, WEAVE, 4MOST, SDSS IV APOGEE, HST-ULLYSES, and VLT-XShootU, as well as complementary observations, will soon enable detailed constraints on theory obtained thanks to quantitative spectroscopic analyses. In addition, new promising research areas are emerging, such as massive-star asteroseismology, that is providing an unprecedented view of their interior. This symposium will enable the experts from complementary communities to gauge the progress that has been made so far and identify areas that still require improvements. Ideas for new technology may also emerge. \nVenue and Lodging\nIAUS 402 will take place at Hotel Coral y Marina, Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico.",
