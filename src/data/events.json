Various explosive cosmic events result from binary stars, as do close double black holes/neutron stars/white dwarfs, type Ia supernovae, X-ray binaries, millisecond pulsars etc. Relying on existing large scientific facilities, classical optical, radio and X-ray observations are discovering increasingly large numbers of such binary stars. A decade ago, the ground-based LIGO/Virgo detected the merging of two stellar-mass binary black holes, opening a new window in gravitational wave astronomy. In the future, with the support of next-generation astronomical instruments, we shall discover many more binary-related celestial objects. Against this backdrop, we convene this conference, inviting all international observers and theoreticians in the field of stellar science to participate in and exchange recent progress related to binary stars and to look forward to future collaboration and development of new directions for research.\n\nConference topics:\n\n1. Binary star interactions: from mass transfer to common envelope evolution.\n2. Supernovae: from progenitor modeling to explosion simulation.\n3. Gravitational wave sources: from double black holes to white dwarfs.\n4. Exotic stars: X-ray binaries, binary pulsars, luminous red novae, hot subdwarfs, cataclysmic variables, symbiotic stars, etc.\n5. Binary population synthesis studies on binary objects.\n6. Binary star observations from large facilities: Gaia, TESS, LAMOST, JWST, FAST, etc.\n\nExplore the Wonders of Lijiang and Beyond\n\nAs we eagerly await your arrival for the conference of “Binary Stars in a New Era”, it is our great pleasure to extend a heartfelt invitation for you to discover the beautiful city of Lijiang.

    "title": "IAU Symposium 402: Massive Stars Across Redshifts",
    "description": "IAU Symposium 402: Massive Stars Across Redshifts in the Era of JWST and Large-Scale Surveys\n\nScientific Motivation\n\nAlthough massive stars are crucial in solving the cosmic puzzle as they are key contributors of ionizing radiation, metals, cosmic rays and dust and, when they die, of neutron stars, black holes, and gravitational waves, many competing factors, are thought to influence their observed properties and challenge our understanding of how these stars evolve and contribute to the Universe.\n\nThe Massive Stars Commission (G2) of the IAU’s Stars and Stellar Physics Division regularly organizes a symposium, typically every 4 years, to present the latest research findings in the field, discuss the status of current research in massive stars, and chart the way forward for future research. The first meeting was in Argentina in 1971, and in the last decade we organized “Massive Stars: from Alpha to Omega” in Greece (2013), “IAUS 329: The Lives and Death Throes of Massive Stars” in New Zealand (2016), and “IAUS 361: Massive Stars Near and Far” in Ireland (2020, postponed to 2022 due to the pandemic).\n\nSince the last symposium organized by the G2 commission (IAUS 361, 2022), the James Webb Space Telescope is dramatically changing our understanding of the early Universe. Important discoveries at high redshift have been made, including galaxies that are too massive for their age, systems with oxygen abundances typical of much later epochs of the Universe, and possible signatures of Pop III stars at z=10. Massive stars, through population synthesis codes,  \nare critical to simulate the evolution and early chemical enrichment of galaxies in the infant Universe, and to analyse the observed spectra of these very high redshift systems.\n\nMany improvements have been made on individual stars, close binaries and population synthesis models.\n\nA better understanding of the impact of massive stars on their surroundings has been achieved and, in addition, analysis techniques are also increasingly sophisticated. These involve accounting for improved or more complete physics, better atomic data, and/or evolving from 1-dimensional to 3D models in the simulations of stellar structure and winds.\n\nDespite the large progress, however, outstanding open questions on massive star evolution and winds remain (e.g. the role of metallicity, true mass loss rates, internal transport mechanisms and magnetic fields to name a few). The view of massive star evolution also needs to be reconciled with the view of the massive star graveyard drawn by gravitational wave experiments. These issues, to be discussed in this symposium, need to be solved to properly account for the role of massive stars across cosmic time, and to maximize the return of empirical datasets and models in the era of JWST and large surveys (SDSS V Mappers, SKA, and Rubin/LSST, among others).\n\nFortunately, the field of massive stars is entering a new era also enabled by large scale spectroscopic surveys. By targeting vast samples of massive stars in the Milky Way and our neighbours the Magellanic Clouds, IACOB, WEAVE, 4MOST, SDSS IV APOGEE, HST-ULLYSES, and VLT-XShootU, as well as complementary observations, will soon enable detailed constraints on theory obtained thanks to quantitative spectroscopic analyses. In addition, new promising research areas are emerging, such as massive-star asteroseismology, that is providing an unprecedented view of their interior. This symposium will enable the experts from complementary communities to gauge the progress that has been made so far and identify areas that still require improvements. Ideas for new technology may also emerge.\n\nVenue and Lodging\n\nIAUS 402 will take place at Hotel Coral y Marina, Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico.",

This event stands as the largest and most comprehensive space festival in the country, uniting companies, startups, academics, and government stakeholders under a singular mission. Since its establishment in 2018, Czech Space Week has evolved into a critical platform designed to accelerate innovation, collaboration, and investment within the Czech and broader European space sectors.\n\n**Core Events and Strategic Focus**\n===================================\n\nThe festival features a curated lineup of events catering to industry professionals and the general public. The flagship **Space2Business** conference showcases collaborative opportunities, technological breakthroughs, and market trends shaping space-related enterprises, both domestically and internationally. Complementing this, the **Copernicus User Forum** convenes experts focusing on Earth observation technologies and their applications, emphasizing the region’s commitment to leveraging space data for environmental and security purposes.\n\nMoreover, Czech Space Week highlights pressing themes such as space defense and international cooperation. A notable seminar titled “Defending European Interests in Space” addresses strategic challenges linked to space security, particularly in light of recent geopolitical tensions. The festival also fosters global dialogue by including sessions aimed at strengthening partnerships with Indo-Pacific space actors.\n\nEmpowering Diversity and Public Engagement\n\nCzech Space Week actively promotes gender diversity through the **Space4Women** initiative. This platform spotlights female leadership and encourages greater inclusion across all space industry levels, from research to entrepreneurship. Public outreach remains vital, with educational workshops, exhibitions, and family-friendly programs designed to inspire youth and engage wider society.\n\nThe week culminates with the elegant **Space Gala**, celebrating achievements and fostering networking among key players in government, industry, and academia. This multifaceted approach ensures that Czech Space Week functions as more than a conference: it serves as a vibrant nexus where innovation meets policy, and science intersects with commerce.\n\n### Czech Republic’s Ascending Role in Space\n\nThe Czech Republic distinguishes itself as one of the most successful newcomers within the European Space Agency (ESA), actively contributing to around 500 ESA projects. Its strengths lie in satellite technology, launch vehicle development, and Earth observation missions. Czech companies and subcontractors are highly engaged in these domains, demonstrating a competitive edge alongside Western European nations.\n\nBy hosting such a diverse and well-structured festival, Czech Space Week fortifies the country’s position as a dynamic and influential player in the global space economy. The 2025 edition not only spotlights national achievements but also accelerates strategic partnerships and innovation transfer, aligning with Europe’s broader space ambitions.",

    "title": "International School on Space Optics ISSO 2025",
    "description": "**ISSO 2025 will take place from 27 – 31 October 2025 at ESA-ESTEC in Noordwijk, the Netherlands.**\n\nWhat is it?\n\nThe International School on Space Optics is an event that targets to serve the community of young engineers and scientists who are already active or have the aspiration to work in the field of Spaceborne Optics. It offers an intensive 5-days immersion program of lectures, design project and visits to space-related facilities. The course can be seen as a “compressed” 1-year class on Space Optics which would have been part of a Master Program in Spaceborne Technologies and Applications. It will allow 360 degrees exposure to all disciplines or optical engineering in space. A Certificate of Attendance will be provided to any participant that has been present consistently throughout the Course.\n\nThe first ISSO was organised as a “Winter College on Space Optics” in February 2015 at the UNESCO International Centre for Theoretical Physics – ICTP within the frame of the “2015-International Year of Light”.  Following this event it was decided to establish the ISSO as a systematic biannual event. In 2017 the ISSO was hosted at ESTEC. In 2019 the ISSO was hosted at ENEA in Rome, Italy. And ISSO 2021 was hosted online.\n\nIn 2025 the School will be held only physically in ESTEC with no option for on-line attendance.\n\nCode of Conduct\n\nThe school organization is committed to providing an environment that is conducive to the free and robust exchange of scientific ideas. This environment requires that all participants be treated with equal consideration and respect. The participants are therefore expected to conduct themselves professionally and respectfully. All forms of bullying, discrimination, and harassment are prohibited. This policy applies to every individual at the event, whether attendee, speaker or other.\n\nHow many people will participate?\n\n80 people will participate in ISSO 2025. The selection is based on merit and expected benefit for the student.\n\nWhy we do it?\n\nEngineers and Scientists working on any discipline of spaceborne optics tend frequently to be very specialised in the narrow field of their first work missing opportunities in serving other disciplines. Also, optical engineers who have not yet engaged in any kind of activity in Space do not have a complete understanding of where their skills could be applied. The school will provide a 360- degree overview of the broad area of Space Optics covering Applications, Instrumentation and Technologies opening hence the horizons and opportunities for the young engineers/scientists to assess better all available opportunities.\n\nISSO is a sister event of the International Conference on Space Optics – ICSO and it is organised biannually in alternative years than ICSO.\n\nThe ICSO proceedings are freely and readily available on the ICSO proceedings site of the SPIE Digital Library.\n\nCEAS Space Journal\n\nThe CEAS Space Journal includes a distinct field on “Optical, Optoelectronics and Photonics” and welcomes papers of ICSO in an extended version of the conference paper including theoretical analysis. Consider an electronic submission through the Journal [website](https://www.springer.com/journal/12567).\n\nHow much will it cost?\n\nThanks to the support of sponsors the fees for the students will be kept to a minimum registration fee.\n\nWho should attend?\n\nYoung engineers or scientists with a background in any field of Optics, Optoelectronics or Photonics. Background should be demonstrated by:\n\n* a Masters or PhD degree in any Optics discipline\n* actively pursuing a PhD in any Optics discipline\n* working as a researcher in any Optics discipline in a university or research centre or industry\n\nWithout having a strict age limit it is expected that the participants will be in generally younger than 40 years old and with limited experience in the field of Space Optics.\n\nCertificate of Attendance\n\nAt the conclusion of the School a “Certificate of Attendance” signed by the School Directors, will be awarded to all students attending the full programme of lectures and visits.\n\nAcademic accreditation\n\nAcademic institutions can recognize the School for its merit. Notice that the University of Padova’s PhD course on Sciences Technologies and Measurements for Space (STMS) [PhD Course – Dottorato | CISAS “G.Colombo” (unipd.it)](https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/QHywCAngcyYm3vt8JPFy) accredits the ISSO with 2 Credit units ([https://www.study.eu/article/what-is-the-ects-european-credit-transfer-and-accumulation-system](https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/fBMqCBgjCQoZ9gUNU6Ib)).\n\nYoung Space Optics Professionals\n\nWhy don’t you ask our “alumnae” for a first hand account of what to expect from attending ISSO. [LinkedIn Link of YSOP.](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/9093885/)",
