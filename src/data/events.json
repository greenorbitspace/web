    "description": "Binary Stars in a New Era Conference 2025\nThis conference, organised by the Yunnan Observatories (CAS), will be held from 24 to 30 August 2025 in Lijiang, Yunnan Province, China \nBinary stars lie at the heart of many key astrophysical phenomena. Various explosive cosmic events result from binary stars, as do close double black holes/neutron stars/white dwarfs, type Ia supernovae, X-ray binaries, millisecond pulsars etc. Relying on existing large scientific facilities, classical optical, radio and X-ray observations are discovering increasingly large numbers of such binary stars. A decade ago, the ground-based LIGO/Virgo detected the merging of two stellar-mass binary black holes, opening a new window in gravitational wave astronomy. In the future, with the support of next-generation astronomical instruments, we shall discover many more binary-related celestial objects. Against this backdrop, we convene this conference, inviting all international observers and theoreticians in the field of stellar science to participate in and exchange recent progress related to binary stars and to look forward to future collaboration and development of new directions for research. \nConference topics:\n\nBinary star interactions: from mass transfer to common envelope evolution.\nSupernovae: from progenitor modeling to explosion simulation.\nGravitational wave sources: from double black holes to white dwarfs.\nExotic stars: X-ray binaries, binary pulsars, luminous red novae, hot subdwarfs, cataclysmic variables, symbiotic stars, etc.\nBinary population synthesis studies on binary objects.\nBinary star observations from large facilities: Gaia, TESS, LAMOST, JWST, FAST, etc.\n\nExplore the Wonders of Lijiang and Beyond\nAs we eagerly await your arrival for the conference of ‚ÄúBinary Stars in a New Era‚Äù, it is our great pleasure to extend a heartfelt invitation for you to discover the beautiful city of Lijiang. It is also a historic city with rich cultural heritages and natural landscapes waiting fou you to explore. Whether you are passionate about history, enamored with natural splendors, or seeking distinctive cultural experiences, Lijiang offers a diverse tapestry of treasures that promises to enrich and delight every esteemed visitor.",

The event will also provide opportunities for networking and collaboration. By combining academic presentations with practical sessions, the conference will enhance the study of cultural astronomy and its tools. \nAbout SEAC\nThe European Society for Astronomy in Culture (SEAC) is a professional association dedicated to exploring the cultural dimensions of astronomy and related fields. Since its founding in Strasbourg, France, in 1992 under the guidance of Professor Carlos Jaschek, SEAC has grown to include around 90 members from 25 countries. While its core membership comprises European scientists, researchers from all continents actively contribute to its interdisciplinary approach. SEAC focuses on areas such as archaeoastronomy, anthropology, ethnoastronomy, the history of astronomy, mythology, spatial archaeology, and cosmology. It was the first professional organization of archaeoastronomers, playing a pivotal role in inspiring similar societies, such as ISAAC in the United States and SIAC in Latin America. \nThrough annual meetings and the publication of proceedings, SEAC fosters scientific exchange and collaboration. Its mission is to promote the study of astronomical practices within their cultural and environmental contexts, highlighting their importance in understanding human societies.",

    "title": "IAU Symposium 402: Massive Stars Across Redshifts",
    "description": "IAU Symposium 402: Massive Stars Across Redshifts in the Era of JWST and Large-Scale Surveys \nScientific Motivation\nAlthough massive stars are crucial in solving the cosmic puzzle as they are key contributors of ionizing radiation, metals, cosmic rays and dust and, when they die, of neutron stars, black holes, and gravitational waves, many competing factors, are thought to influence their observed properties and challenge our understanding of how these stars evolve and contribute to the Universe. \nThe Massive Stars Commission (G2) of the IAU‚Äôs Stars and Stellar Physics Division regularly organizes a symposium, typically every 4 years, to present the latest research findings in the field, discuss the status of current research in massive stars, and chart the way forward for future research. The first meeting was in Argentina in 1971, and in the last decade we organized ‚ÄúMassive Stars: from Alpha to Omega‚Äù in Greece (2013), ‚ÄúIAUS 329: The Lives and Death Throes of Massive Stars‚Äù in New Zealand (2016), and ‚ÄúIAUS 361: Massive Stars Near and Far‚Äù in Ireland (2020, postponed to 2022 due to the pandemic). \nSince the last symposium organized by the G2 commission (IAUS 361, 2022), the James Webb Space Telescope is dramatically changing our understanding of the early Universe. Important discoveries at high redshift have been made, including galaxies that are too massive for their age, systems with oxygen abundances typical of much later epochs of the Universe, and possible signatures of Pop III stars at z=10. Massive stars, through population synthesis codes,\nare critical to simulate the evolution and early chemical enrichment of galaxies in the infant Universe, and to analyse the observed spectra of these very high redshift systems. \nMany improvements have been made on individual stars, close binaries and population synthesis models. \nA better understanding of the impact of massive stars on their surroundings has been achieved and, in addition, analysis techniques are also increasingly sophisticated. These involve accounting for improved or more complete physics, better atomic data, and/or evolving from 1-dimensional to 3D models in the simulations of stellar structure and winds. \nDespite the large progress, however, outstanding open questions on massive star evolution and winds remain (e.g. the role of metallicity, true mass loss rates, internal transport mechanisms and magnetic fields to name a few). The view of massive star evolution also needs to be reconciled with the view of the massive star graveyard drawn by gravitational wave experiments. These issues, to be discussed in this symposium, need to be solved to properly account for the role of massive stars across cosmic time, and to maximize the return of empirical datasets and models in the era of JWST and large surveys (SDSS V Mappers, SKA, and Rubin/LSST, among others). \nFortunately, the field of massive stars is entering a new era also enabled by large scale spectroscopic surveys. By targeting vast samples of massive stars in the Milky Way and our neighbours the Magellanic Clouds, IACOB, WEAVE, 4MOST, SDSS IV APOGEE, HST-ULLYSES, and VLT-XShootU, as well as complementary observations, will soon enable detailed constraints on theory obtained thanks to quantitative spectroscopic analyses. In addition, new promising research areas are emerging, such as massive-star asteroseismology, that is providing an unprecedented view of their interior. This symposium will enable the experts from complementary communities to gauge the progress that has been made so far and identify areas that still require improvements. Ideas for new technology may also emerge. \nVenue and Lodging\nIAUS 402 will take place at Hotel Coral y Marina, Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico.",
