    "description": "The conference for Adaptive Mesh Refinement and Applications 2025 (AMR 25) will take place September 02 to 04 at the DLR in Cologne.\nAdaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) is a computational technique used in numerical simulations to enhance efficiency and accuracy. By dynamically adjusting the resolution of a computational grid, AMR focuses computational resources on areas of interest — such as regions with complex phenomena or steep gradients — while maintaining coarser resolution in less critical areas. This adaptability allows for detailed modeling of complex systems, such as fluid dynamics, astrophysics, and structural analysis, without incurring the high computational cost of a uniformly fine mesh. The result is a more effective use of computational power, leading to faster simulations and more accurate results.\nAt AMR25 we welcome contributions from AMR and related fields, including other adaptive methods.\nPossible topics include, but are not limited to:\nDynamic and static AMR algorithms and techniques\nApplications of dynamic and static AMR\nTime adaptivity\nMesh generation and CAD\nOther adaptive methods, such as Partition of Unity methods, X-FEM, p-adaptivity etc.\nWe are looking forward to welcome you in Cologne in September 2025.\nSincerely yours,\nJohannes Holke\nChair of AMR2025",

Systemic risk mitigation, strategic resilience, and adaptation require breakthrough transformation and systemic leadership. Both need patient funding and rarely deliver quarter-to-quarter profit growth.\n\nHow can we dismantle widespread short-term return expectations—a key systemic barrier to unlocking long-term shareholder and systemic value?\n\nThis webinar provides a step-by-step guide on how exactly to do so.\n\n“In today’s world, pursuing short-term profits is how we wipe out all shareholder value…along with everything we hold most dear.” — Alice Kalro\n\nIf the date & time for the webinar (shown above in UK time) do not work for you, you may register to receive a recording.",

The summit will host some of the world’s leading voices in economic transformation. Prominent speakers include Katherine Trebeck (WEAll, Club of Rome), Amitabh Behar (Oxfam International), Ashish Kothari (Vikalp Sangam), Mads Christensen (Greenpeace International), and Simel Eşim (ILO).\n\nFor those unable to attend in-person in Istanbul, online participation is available.

Spatial data is increasingly important in such decision-making being used for marine planning, conflict management and environmental management. GeoData’s experienced GIS trainers have teamed up with ABPmer GIS Consultants, who specialise in the coastal and marine sector, to create a course that will provide you with the background and skills necessary to utilise these powerful tools and techniques. The course introduces GIS concepts and techniques using QGIS and is intended for those who have little to no GIS knowledge or who wish to undertake some formalized training in QGIS having been largely self-taught in the past. A project showcase, drawn from ABPmer’s portfolio, illustrates how spatial data has been used within GIS to support coastal and marine decision making.  The course also considers common problems faced when mapping the coastal and offshore zones (including projections, vertical datums, etc.) Find more information and register directly with GeoData, University of Southampton ",

We hosted three provocations from the community on the day, to help shape the themes for T&SC, elicited through community based discussions. These provided the basis for the eight events Innovate UK has hosted over the past year. The 2025 Partner Event aims to reflect and to look forward. The community should be driven through purpose and underpinned by the value of collection action. Understanding whether convening through the T&SC community is supporting progress is essential to this consideration. Much has changed over the past 12 months, for Innovate UK – a new Executive Chair, and within our environment – the emergence of Skills England and the Industrial Strategy. The coming together of innovation, business and skills has never felt more tangible. So we want to create conversations about how we are seeing skills priorities coming to the fore, how the UK’s mission of economic growth and the aligned success of innovation and technology is underpinned by our people and skills focus. The afternoon will be focused on the T&SC community. With provocations from three sector bodies most closely aligned with innovation and technology, we will create a space where the community can prioritise efforts for the year ahead.",

      "description": "Overview What does the future look like to you? At Innovate UK, we’re interested to hear about what you imagine lies ahead. Because how we shape the future starts with how we think about it today. Building on the success of our Glimpse of the Future series (and our compelling pilot event in March 2025 exploring human longevity), we’re proud to introduce our new Human Futures series. This time, we’re shifting our lens to take a deeper, sociological look at the technologies of tomorrow and the societal challenges they’re meant to address. How will we live, work and connect in the next 20 to 50 years? What innovations will help us tackle growing concerns around ageing, inequality, identity, and wellbeing? To explore these pressing questions, we’ve invited a panel of thought-provoking experts to join Innovate UK’s resident futurist, Jonathan Mitchener, in a fireside conversation. Together, they’ll examine how future change (across economic, social, artistic, cultural, and psychological dimensions) will shape human experience. But this won’t be a passive affair. About the events We’re looking for curious, creative, and collaborative minds to take part in the discussion. Participants will work in groups to reflect on the insights shared, and collectively imagine future artefacts, innovative concepts or solutions, that could help address one of the societal challenges discussed. Please note that this event will not be recorded. Instead, attendees will receive an anonymised summary of the discussions afterwards, a small token of our appreciation for contributing to this future-facing dialogue. We hope you’ll join us!

      "description": "Overview The textiles and apparel sector uses approximately 93 billion cubic metres of water every year which is enough to meet the drinking water needs of five million people, according to the United Nations Trade & Development (UNCTAD). This equates to in excess of 37 million Olympic-sized swimming pools filled annually. As water scarcity becomes a growing global concern, the textile industry must urgently shift toward water-efficient and sustainable production models. This webinar explores water consumption across the textile supply chain from fibre farming to fabric processing. It will showcase real world examples from Africa, Asia and UK, innovations that are reducing water use and driving sustainable transformation and steps towards circularity within the textiles industry.",

      "description": "Overview Building on the success of our previous events , we are proud to introduce our next Future Tech Deep Dive series, which will bring together thought-provoking experts from business, scientific backgrounds, academia and Government with curious, creative, and collaborative minds to discuss how technologies will develop over the course of the next 20-50 years. The primary aim of this event series is to delve into the longer-term potential innovations within specific technology areas. Topics that we have considered previously encompass Future Semiconductors , Neuromorphic Computing, Nature-inspired Materials , Engineering Biology, and Telecommunications . About the Event Who should attend? Senior academics, technologists, and scientific leaders from all sectors, any sized organisation and diverse backgrounds, primarily from businesses in roles with an interest in, or responsibility for future strategy. What should you expect? To provide context to discuss possible scenarios for the forthcoming semi-centennial. Our guest speakers will give their personal views on the long-term potential of a chosen technology topic. Innovate UK’s Futurist, Jonathan Mitchener, will summarise what has been shared to set the scene and weave contributions together. Participants will work in breakout room groups to reflect on the insights shared and collectively discuss the prospective technology developments raised and identify potential challenges and opportunities. What you’ll learn Designed both for topic experts who are keen to share their views, and for those who want to learn more about a key technology and its potential future development, this series of events will enable you to: gain valuable insights into how the technology is evolving contribute your own hopes, concerns, expectations, and ideas for potential applications develop a clearer understanding of how particular technologies could shape the world explore the opportunities it might create for your business in the years to come What you need to know Please note that these events will not be recorded. Instead, participants will receive a non-attributed, and anonymised summary of all the discussions after each event. If you’re interested in other future-facing conversations, then please explore our forthcoming in-person Glimpse of the Future events , and our innovative Human Futures Series .

    "description": "ESA cordially invites you to the 6th ESA Mission Operations Hands-On Experience at ESOC, Darmstadt.\nMission Operations at its best! For the sixth time, ESA offers this unique 4-day course to bring to life the fascinating world of spacecraft operations with its unique challenges and need for excellent teamwork.\nThis course provides an insight into the secrets of ESA Space Mission Operation’s success, covering operations concepts, architecture and interfaces, the roles and responsibilities of the different teams, the mission planning and scheduling processes and the different challenges encountered in each mission phase. Finally, how to effectively manage spacecraft anomalies and contingency recovery operations will be discussed and later practised.\nThe course will be delivered through lectures by ESA experts specialised in the different mission operations domains. Real stories of operational staff battling with wayward spacecraft will be shared whenever appropriate. In addition to the lectures, the participants will gain hands-on experience in mission operations and will be able to immediately apply their gained knowledge during a challenging team simulation set in ESOC’s famous Main Control Room, the heart of ESA mission operations.\nThis intensive technical course focuses on sharing ESA's vast know-how and expertise in operations with the participants.

    "description": "As part of the ESA Green Agenda and the Clean Space Office, we must drive the design of space products and services towards minimizing the environmental impacts throughout their entire life cycle.\nBuilding on the insights from the first conference on ‘Understanding the Atmospheric Effects from Spacecraft Re-Entry’, the workshop series on the environmental impact of space transportation systems, and continued joint efforts of the AIRL (Atmospheric Impact of Re-entry and Launches) initiative driven with the ESSC, this second workshop focuses on identifying key scientific gaps and formulating urgent recommendations to support further research. \nIt aims to emphasize the critical importance of collecting real-world data to advance our understanding of the physicochemical processes associated with spacecraft launch and re-entry emissions. With the rapid growth of the space industry and the increasing frequency of satellite launches and re-entries, assessing their atmospheric and environmental impact has become a critical priority. \nRecent findings indicate that anthropogenic metal emissions from spacecraft re-entries could become a major contributor to the stratospheric particle load, exceeding the natural meteoritic influx. Observations from high-altitude aircraft and ground-based facilities have identified metal-rich particles in the stratosphere, raising concerns about their potential role in ozone depletion, atmospheric chemistry, cloud formation, and radiative forcing. The World Meteorological Organization warns ‘’that these interactions are poorly understood...and periodic assessment and critical knowledge gap identification are warranted.’’ \nThis workshop will explore the key scientific, engineering, and environmental issues related to spacecraft launch and re-entry, including:\n\nField measurement campaigns – reviewing existing field study findings and exploring future initiatives to detect and analyse aerosols containing launcher and spacecraft-derived particles.\nChemistry of launch and re-entry emissions – investigating how spaceflight compounds such as nitrous oxide, metal oxides, black carbon, and ablated materials interact with the gases and aerosols already present in the ‘background’ stratosphere and mesosphere, including their potential to catalyse ozone depletion and alter cloud formation.\nAdvancements in modelling and laboratory simulations – assessing how experimental and computational approaches can improve predictions of atmospheric impacts.\nMethodologies for integrating atmospheric impacts into life cycle assessments – Evaluating how launchers and spacecraft can be designed to minimize environmental impact.\nCross-disciplinary collaboration – bringing together experts in atmospheric science, the space sector, and policy to identify research gaps and explore strategies for regulation.\n\n \nAs space activities continue to expand, coordinating upper-atmosphere research and data-driven policymaking is increasingly essential. This workshop will provide a collaborative platform for the scientific and industrial communities to align efforts, ensuring that future space missions adopt sustainable and environmentally responsible practices.\nWe invite researchers, industry professionals, and policymakers to actively contribute to this discussion and play a key role in shaping the future of atmospheric impact assessment in the space sector. \n\nhttps://indico.esa.int/event/579/",

    "title": "11th European Space Propulsion System Simulation (ESPSS) Workshop",
    "description": "Speakers: Leonard Schraven, Johan Steelant (ESA - ESTEC)\n\nFollowing the needs of the European Space Propulsion Community, a first workshop on ESPSS was collocated with the ESA Space Propulsion 2012 Conference at Bordeaux.  Due to its success and on users’ request, ESA-ESTEC responsible for the ESPSS development is now preparing the 11th ESPSS workshop covering the following topics: \n\nESPSS 3.10.0 release notes\nESPSS and EcosimPro roadmaps for 2025 and beyond\nUser’s round table\n Requests for new improvements\nESPSS training\n\nThe workshop will be divided into two days.  \nDuring the first day, a general overview of the European Space Propulsion System Simulation will be given by ESA and Empresarios Agrupados - Ghesa, where the main capabilities of the EcosimPro tool and the ESPSS libraries will be explained, as well as the status of the main developments that are currently ongoing in ESPSS.\nThe floor will be then opened to industrial and research institutions’ users providing the opportunity to present their work on the ESPSS, as well as different suggestions and questions stated by the different users and attendants, based on their experience and wishes.\nThe day will end with a round table where all the users can suggest extensions and improvements of the tool to address their new needs for future applications.\nDuring the second day, two parallel training sessions will be given by Empresarios Agrupados - Ghesa: introductory (for new users) and advanced (for users with expertise in ESPSS). The contents of the advanced training are partially based on users’ requests. Hence, participants are encouraged to suggest topics for the advanced session (link available in the registration form).  \nThe objective of the workshop is twofold. The first is to highlight the upgrades realized both on EcosimPro Platform and the ESPSS toolkit along with new extensions. These upgrades and extensions will be presented directly by the related developers. The other goal is to reinforce the constructive feed-back on the simulation tool in which the experience of developers and users are openly discussed providing the basis for future improvements of the EcosimPro/ESPSS tool environment. Therefore, ESPSS users are encouraged to elaborate and provide specific test cases upfront for troubleshooting and support during the workshop.\nTemporary licenses will be provided to the attendees for the duration of the workshop. \nRegistration is free of charge but is required for participation and is restricted to organisations from ESA Member States and Associate Member States.\n\nhttps://indico.esa.int/event/580/",

    "title": "EU-ESA Workshop on Astrometric and Radar Observations of NEOs",
    "description": "Speakers: Richard Moissl (ESA), Juan L. Cano (ESA), Maxime Devogele (ESA NEOCC), Thea Dethlefsen (EC)\n\n\nThe European Commission and ESA’s Planetary Defence Office together are organising the “EU-ESA Workshop on Astrometric and Radar Observations of NEOs” which will take place on 6–8 October 2025 at the European Space Research Institute (ESRIN) in Frascati, Italy.\n\nThe aim of this workshop is to bring together the international asteroid and planetary defence communities to critically assess and improve current practices in astrometric and radar measurements as well as orbit determination of NEOs. With the growing importance of precise tracking and prediction of asteroid trajectories, the workshop will focus on the sources of uncertainty in both optical and radar data, methods for properly estimating and reporting them, and the incorporation of new technologies and techniques to enhance the reliability of orbital predictions.\nKey Objectives of the Workshop:\n\nAssess current methodologies used to estimate and propagate astrometric and timing uncertainties, including mathematical frameworks, calibration strategies, and effects in orbital determination.\nPromote the development of community guidelines on how to report and quantify uncertainties in astrometry and timing.\nInvestigate new observational techniques and technologies (e.g., synthetic tracking, CMOS sensors, AI-assisted processing) and assess their impact on astrometric accuracy.\nDiscuss other sources of astrometry/asteroid position measurement such as radar, stellar occultations, and negative or precovery observations.\nIdentify facilities and instruments that could contribute to precise astrometry in the near future.\n\nTentative Sessions:\n\n Astrometric Observations of NEOsThis session will serve as an introduction to astrometric observations and to provide an overview of the current capabilities and limitations of facilities involved in the astrometric observation of NEOs. Topics will include observational strategies, instrumentation, and data acquisition methods. The session will also highlight recent progress in synthetic tracking, including non-linear approaches, as innovative techniques for improving the detection and tracking of faint and fast-moving NEOs.\nOn the Uncertainties of Astrometric Observations and effects on orbit determinationThis session will delve into the quantitative analysis and interpretation of uncertainties associated with astrometric measurements. It will focus on how these uncertainties are estimated, modeled, and reported—differentiating between random (statistical) and systematic sources of error. The session will also assess the implications of poorly characterized uncertainties for orbit determination and risk assessment. Drawing on case studies, including recent IAWN campaigns, the session will showcase lessons learned and best practices, with particular attention to methodologies for evaluating and communicating timing and positional accuracy in astrometric data.\nNon-Standard Astrometric RecordsThis session will explore unconventional yet valuable sources of astrometric information. Stellar occultations offer opportunities for high-precision position measurements, while archival data, including precoveries and negative observations, can provide critical constraints for orbit determination and long-arc fitting of NEO trajectories.\nRadar Observations and the Perspective for a European Radar FacilityRadar plays a pivotal role in refining NEO orbits and improving impact predictions. This session will cover how radar measurements are acquired, calibrated, and interpreted, and discuss how these data are incorporated into orbit determination. A key focus will be the current status and future prospects for establishing dedicated radar capabilities in Europe to support planetary defence efforts.\nEmerging Technologies and TechniquesLooking to the future, this session will cover the adoption of CMOS sensors and their astrometric performance, as well as the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning into astrometric data reduction pipelines. Presentations will also introduce upcoming facilities and instruments expected to significantly enhance the astrometric tracking of NEOs in the coming years.\n\nA dedicated session will aim to consolidate input from all participants into a community white paper or technical document outlining best practices for uncertainty estimation and reporting.\n\nhttps://indico.esa.int/event/590/",

    "description": "Speakers: Tim Flohrer (ESA/ESOC)\n\nESA has been running optical surveys for space debris via the Optical Ground Station (OGS) at Tenerife from the mid 1990ies. The surveys  became operational in 1999.\nThese ESA surveys have been regarded as highly successful, and the many successes and first discoveries (small debris in GEO, small debris in GTO, monitoring of related clouds, discovery of HAMR, and their characterisation via spectra, photometry, and long-term monitoring, etc.) deserve a symposium as the leader of these activities, Prof. Thomas Schildknecht, is retiring from the University of Bern. \nThis symposiums aims to revisit the scientific results, and to connect the findings to the emerging future needs, such as the “Zero Debris Approach” that a community of like-minded actors have defined recently.\nCelebrating the successes should also leave room for discussing the main challenges and how they have been solved, what we learned from the surveys, and maybe also sharing so far untold stories. \nThe symposium is planned to take place at the „Space Eye“, the largest publicly accessible telescope in Switzerland and planetarium, which is located just outside of Bern. On-site and virtual participation in the planned symposium will be possible, subject to a confirmed registration for logistical reasons.",

The topical focus of this event is on ejecta modelling and small debris. \nAny contributions related to the hypervelocity imapct domain are welcome. This is an indicative list of possible questions related to the topical focus:\n\nWhat do we know about releasing ejecta in hypervelocity impacts? Is there experimental data adnd or model avaiable? \nWhat do we know about small space debris? Are there datasets in terms of dedicated instrumentation or indirect detection (e.g. surface degradation)? What ae the uncertainties in current modelling?\nWhat small debris population is considered to be relevant in terms of hypervelocity impact risks to space assets? How much of this relevanr space debris popultion is releaed in impacts? How does this environment develop?  \n\n \nThe meeting will likely be split into two technical sessions according to topical focus. We will make time for discussions specific technical, scientific and programmatic topics. The possibilit to have lab tour at ESTEC will be explored. \nA dedicated interactive session is intended at the end of the event to exchange on the event and streamline a way forward towards future events.\nIn-person participation to the event is strongly encouraged.

    "description": "How can Earth Observation (EO) and SpaceTech help us overcome real-world sustainability challenges?\n\nJoin us on 30th September in Leeds for a powerful day of insights, inspiration, and collaboration as we explore how EO data can unlock sustainable impact across industries, and what's holding it back.\n\nCo-hosted by UK-EONS and West Yorkshire Combined Authority (WYCA), in collaboration with Space Hub Yorkshire, this event brings together leaders from the space sector and UK industries to examine how EO technologies are being used to monitor our planet, drive environmental decision-making, and build more sustainable systems. A key focus will be on the barriers that still prevent wider EO adoption, from data accessibility and integration to sector-specific awareness and policy gaps, and how we can begin to break them down.\n\nThrough expert talks, case studies, and cross-sector networking, you’ll discover how EO is being used today to monitor our planet, guide environmental decision-making, and create smarter, more resilient systems.\n\nWhether you're a policymaker, innovator, business leader, or just EO-curious — come ready to rethink what's possible.",

This talk dives into the real-world challenges of tackling cloud emissions, starting with the incomplete, often inaccurate, and rarely actionable data provided by the cloud providers.\r\n\r\nWe'll explore the current landscape of commercial solutions, share how we partnered with one based in our region to help a leading Bristol-based organisation cut their cloud emissions, and discuss how these tools compare in practice.\r\n\r\nAlong the way, we'll introduce key concepts, offer practical tips, and dig into some of the toughest hurdles—from navigating imperfect data to convincing internal stakeholders, all grounded in my own experience as a developer. We'll also touch on a topic that everybody is expecting: how to estimate the carbon impact of AI workloads and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS).\r\n\r\nFinally, we’ll explore the growing ecosystem of open source tools, and how they can empower individuals across an organisation to take initiative, influence decision-making, and foster a culture of sustainability.",

Ensuring our world is a happy place is really important to me, so when making CRZyBest creations I always try my best to look after my customers and our planet too, which is why I make every effort to source my energy, tools and materials from sustainable and ethical sources. Before starting my business, I was a teacher for 20 years and I still very much enjoy supporting others in their businesses, creativity and sustainability journey. I’m a massive advocate of collaboration over competition and my favourite things to make are inspired by dogs and beer, so when I’m not creating in my Shedquarters, you can find me walking my dog or sharing stories with people in my favourite pub, so what better next step than to start hosting ‘People, Planet, Pint’ in The Flowerpot!\nOur Sponsor\nKRYSTAL\nare an award-winning, 100% renewably powered web hosting provider, with datacentres in the UK, US, & Europe.

So that is now reflected in all that Impressions does and has led to the creation of The Really Good Business – a coaching and mentoring service aimed at helping others grow their business and find greater joy through purposeful business practice. We are also launching the RGB Rebels Club which is a Bi-monthly meeting in partnership with Wigan and Leigh College.\nI regularly support other local businesses, Social Enterprises, charities and the councils in the areas we work in.

I’m a non-traditional, eco-friendly Silversmith & Sculptor, working from my CRZyBest Shedquarters in Derby, creating tiny sculptures in metal clay and turning them into jewellery and accessories. Ensuring our world is a happy place is really important to me, so when making CRZyBest creations I always try my best to look after my customers and our planet too, which is why I make every effort to source my energy, tools and materials from sustainable and ethical sources. Before starting my business, I was a teacher for 20 years and I still very much enjoy supporting others in their businesses, creativity and sustainability journey. I’m a massive advocate of collaboration over competition and my favourite things to make are inspired by dogs and beer, so when I’m not creating in my Shedquarters, you can find me walking my dog or sharing stories with people in my favourite pub, so what better next step than to start hosting ‘People, Planet, Pint’ in The Flowerpot!\nOur Sponsor\nKRYSTAL\nare an award-winning, 100% renewably powered web hosting provider, with datacentres in the UK, US, & Europe.

    "description": "ESG is moving from voluntary ambition to mandated action.\nAs Europe rolls out sweeping new regulations – from the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) to the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CS3D) – businesses face unprecedented obligations to report on sustainability and police their supply chains. At the same time, regulators around the world are ramping up ESG enforcement, and courts are seeing a surge in climate and ESG-related lawsuits.\nThe question is no longer if companies and their legal advisors should prioritize ESG, but how to do so effectively, in full compliance, and in ways that stand up to scrutiny.\nLegal ESG: Europe 2025, taking place on 16th October 2025 at Baker McKenzie’s Paris office, is an opportunity for law firm leaders, in-house counsel, compliance professionals, and ESG experts to come together, learn from each other, and drive the ESG agenda forward. It’s a chance to reflect on the progress made so far, confront the challenges on the horizon, and commit to a future where ESG is a fundamental element of corporate strategy and legal practice. Join us to exchange ideas, prepare for what’s next, and ensure that your organization is ready for this new chapter of ESG.\nDiscussions Will Include\nHow will new EU directives like CSRD and CS3D reshape corporate accountability and legal risk?\nAre companies prepared to meet stringent ESG reporting requirements and conduct due diligence across global supply chains?\nWhat do rising climate lawsuits and greenwashing crackdowns mean for businesses and their counsel?\nHow are regulators and investors globally enforcing ESG commitments and holding organizations accountable?\nHow is the era of ESG accountability impacting corporate governance and the responsibilities of boards and legal advisors?\nHow can legal and compliance teams proactively mitigate ESG risks while driving sustainable value for their organizations?\nConfirm your place by July 31st and save $300\nRegister here: https://www.insidepractice.com/legal-esg-europe-2025",

We are also launching the RGB Rebels Club which is a Bi-monthly meeting in partnership with Wigan and Leigh College.\nI regularly support other local businesses, Social Enterprises, charities and the councils in the areas we work in.

    "description": "In 2025 the corporate sustainability landscape is defined by regulatory uncertainty, unchartered climate risk and geopolitical shocks. The threat of deregulation compounded with the increased scrutiny on the commercial value of sustainability investments translates into real-world impact across complex global supply chains. Sustainability professionals are overrun, facing hurdles in data management, struggling with scalability, and navigating swings in trends.\r\n\r\nWith only 5 years until 2030, corporations are at a major inflection point. Interpreting unclear regulations, building compelling business cases and managing intricate supply chains effectively while addressing complex data challenges is paramount to future success. Developing a proactive approach and moving beyond compliance-driven reporting will be difficult and cannot be done alone.\r\n\r\nSustainability Europe 2025 offers you a unique opportunity to meet the moment and directly address these challenges. Join 500+ senior corporate executives as we provide practical strategies to navigate regulatory overload, build financially sound sustainability arguments, and drive real action. Through peer-to-peer roundtables, expert panels, and insightful fireside chats, you will gain clarity, create valuable networks, and acquire actionable tools to thrive in this evolving landscape. Attending will give you the tools to drive meaningful, value-creating sustainability strategies within your organisation.\r\n\r\nFor the past 24 years this, our flagship European event, has outlined the latest trends, tactics and opportunities in sustainable business. Join us at this critical juncture in October as we drive sustainable action and deliver corporate value.",

Ensuring our world is a happy place is really important to me, so when making CRZyBest creations I always try my best to look after my customers and our planet too, which is why I make every effort to source my energy, tools and materials from sustainable and ethical sources. Before starting my business, I was a teacher for 20 years and I still very much enjoy supporting others in their businesses, creativity and sustainability journey. I’m a massive advocate of collaboration over competition and my favourite things to make are inspired by dogs and beer, so when I’m not creating in my Shedquarters, you can find me walking my dog or sharing stories with people in my favourite pub, so what better next step than to start hosting ‘People, Planet, Pint’ in The Flowerpot!\nOur Sponsor\nKRYSTAL\nare an award-winning, 100% renewably powered web hosting provider, with datacentres in the UK, US, & Europe.

I care about my customers and the team, I’m a bit of a tree hugger, believe in truth and justice and like to ensure that playing fields are as level as possible. So that is now reflected in all that Impressions does and has led to the creation of The Really Good Business – a coaching and mentoring service aimed at helping others grow their business and find greater joy through purposeful business practice.

Zwozny-Bestwick. I’m a non-traditional, eco-friendly Silversmith & Sculptor, working from my CRZyBest Shedquarters in Derby, creating tiny sculptures in metal clay and turning them into jewellery and accessories. Ensuring our world is a happy place is really important to me, so when making CRZyBest creations I always try my best to look after my customers and our planet too, which is why I make every effort to source my energy, tools and materials from sustainable and ethical sources. Before starting my business, I was a teacher for 20 years and I still very much enjoy supporting others in their businesses, creativity and sustainability journey. I’m a massive advocate of collaboration over competition and my favourite things to make are inspired by dogs and beer, so when I’m not creating in my Shedquarters, you can find me walking my dog or sharing stories with people in my favourite pub, so what better next step than to start hosting ‘People, Planet, Pint’ in The Flowerpot!\nOur Sponsor\nKRYSTAL\nare an award-winning, 100% renewably powered web hosting provider, with datacentres in the UK, US, & Europe.

    "title": "CATRINE project and TransCom online workshop",
    "description": "Speakers: Anna Agusti-Panareda (ECMWF)\n\nWorkshop Timings: 15:00 to 18:00 (BST), 16:00 to 19:00 (CEST)\n\n \nThe CATRINE project will host an online workshop to discuss a new TransCom model intercomparison protocol focusing on high resolution and the transport of CO2 from fossil fuel emissions.\nRegistration is open to the CATRINE project participants, the TransCom community plus invited guests. Registration will be moderated by the event organisers.\nBackground and motivation:\nMonitoring the greenhouse gases CO2 and CH4 from space has made great strides over the past decade, in particular in terms of imaging capability. Existing instruments for CO2 include NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) with continuous sampling of cloud-free regions along the orbital path at a resolution of 3 km2, and NASA's OCO-3 which introduced the possibility of performing successive side-by-side scans of small areas (∼80 × 80 km2). For CH4, the TROPOMI instrument on board Copernicus Sentinel-5P provides near-daily surface coverage of cloud-free regions at a spatial resolution of up to 38.5 km2. In addition, retrieval capabilities at higher spatial resolution are emerging, for instance from Copernicus Sentinel-2 or from Greenhouse Gases Satellite (GHGSat). In the near future, the Copernicus CO2 Monitoring Mission (CO2M) will extend the imaging capability of CO2 to a level comparable to the existing one for CH4 from TROPOMI. This new wealth of CO2 and CH4 satellite retrievals pushes the application of such satellite data towards the inference of anthropogenic emissions and absorptions, with target spatial scales much finer than the traditional zonal or subcontinental scales of global atmospheric inversions. In this regard, the current generation of global atmospheric transport models that operate primarily at resolutions coarser than one degree, risks obsolescence because most models cannot exploit the higher resolution information in which most of the anthropogenic signals reside.\nWith this new protocol, we aim at stimulating high-resolution tracer transport modelling by setting-up a dedicated intercomparison exercise. By “high-resolution”, we first mean the equivalent of a grid spacing of 100 km in the horizontal, or a minimum of 51,000 horizontal grid points (about 1 degree × 1 degree resolution in the Tropics) to pave the world. On the vertical, we put a simple lower limit of 50 layers between the surface and the top of the atmosphere, assuming that it implies sufficient refinement of the planetary boundary layer and around the tropopause for constructive intercomparison. Indeed, the model vertical profiles will be particularly looked at in this exercise. We expect that their evaluation for several tracers using observed profiles from tall towers, aircraft and AirCore soundings will shed some light into the current discrepancies of atmospheric inversions that assimilate column retrievals or air-sample measurements. \nSimulated tracers will be compared with each other, as will vertically integrated mass fluxes for total column. The reference observations will be diverse: ground-based or satellite tracer retrievals, air-sample measurements, as well as meteorological observations. We will define metrics to score the model performance. We will investigate how model configuration, like the vertical resolution, influences the model skill. The diagnostics will be applied to all tracers on weekly to monthly timescales, focusing on the impact of transport errors on the seasonal cycle at various layers and the total column. The correlation between the errors in the different layers with the error in the total column will support the attribution of the transport error.  The high-resolution simulation database will be the first of this sort and may serve various applications beyond the planned model evaluation, from, e.g., model uncertainty quantification to AI training. \nThis initiative originates from the European project Carbon Atmospheric Tracer Research to Improve Numerics and Evaluation (CATRINE), which funds the coordination of the intercomparison, as well as some contributors, but it is hoped that other partners in the world will join the momentum and contribute to the study with their respective model and expertise. \nThe meeting will include half a day of presentations and discussions of this new protocol to get input from the TransCom community.\nThe CATRINE project is funded by the European Union, Grant Agreement 101135000.\n \n\nhttps://events.ecmwf.int/event/461/",

    "description": "\nPart of ECMWF's 50th anniversary celebrations in Bologna \nAs part of the 50th anniversary celebrations of ECMWF, the annual Using ECMWF's Forecasts (UEF2025) event will take place in the historic city of Bologna, at the Regione Emilia Romagna and the Tecnopolo di Bologna – ECMWF’s purpose-built data centre hosting our supercomputing facility.\n“Using ECMWF’s Forecasts” is a forum for ECMWF forecast users to exchange ideas, share experiences, and discuss the use and performance of ECMWF's forecasts and related products to ensure ECMWF’s forecasts continue to meet user needs. It is open to all ECMWF forecast users around the world and provides an opportunity to give feedback on ECMWF forecast performance and available products and services, stay informed about ECMWF’s latest updates and plans, and connect with ECMWF and fellow users to share experiences and network.\nLocation\nUEF2025 will take place in two Bologna venues:\nRegione Emilia Romagna · Viale della Fiera, 8, 40127 Bologna BO, Italy\nTecnopolo Data Manifattura Emilia-Romagna, Via Stalingrado 84/3, 40128 Bologna\n2025 theme: Exploring the Past, Present and Future of ECMWF forecast products and services\nAs ECMWF celebrates its 50th anniversary, UEF2025 will explore the evolution of ECMWF forecast products and services over the years and into the future. Over the decades, improvements in numerical weather prediction (NWP), forecast products, and services across meteorology, hydrology, air quality, and climate - including extreme event prediction - have supported Member and Co-operating States and the meteorological communities' ability to forecast and respond to weather and its impacts.\nCollaboration with Member and Co-operating States has been key to achieving ECMWF's goals, the valuable input, ideas and expertise driving its progress and success. Throughout this journey, ECMWF has remained committed to supporting users to make the most of its products and services through training, documentation, and dedicated support. By understanding user needs, ECMWF continues to design its products and services with a strong focus on usability and impact.\nECMWF ran its first operational medium-range forecast in 1979, its first operational ensemble predictions in 1992 and its first reanalysis (ERA-15) in 1993. To support these, a range of products and tools have been developed, including forecast products like the Extreme Forecast Index (EFI), verification scores to monitor progress, datasets like ERA5, and services such as ecCharts, training courses, and Jupyter Notebooks. These efforts, commonly in collaboration with National Meteorological Services of Member and Co-operating States, have helped to deliver maximum value to society. ECMWF's role in environmental services started in 2015 with the signing of the Copernicus agreement for ECMWF to deliver the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) and the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) and support the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS). This was followed in 2022 with the launch of Destination Earth (DestinE), further advancing ECMWF’s contributions to environmental prediction for extremes and climate.\nPresently, machine learning is a key component of ECMWF's work. A key milestone of this was the release of AIFS Single, ECMWF's first operational machine learning model, on 25 February 2025. Work continues not only on the machine-learning-based models themselves but also their evaluation compared to traditional NWP. Other exciting developments include ECMWF's Open Data strategy, facilitating more forecast data availability to the whole community. New products such as simulated satellite imagery, visibility meteograms and severe convection forecast products have recently been released with many existing products and services undergoing development and upgrades, often in collaboration with Member and Co-operating State National Meteorological Services.\nLooking to the future, the ECMWF 2025-2034 Strategy was released in February 2025, placing strong emphasis on impact and aiming to optimise, enhance and deliver world-leading quality products to meet users' needs through improved science and technology.

    "title": "Informal Seminar: Delving Into the FAIR Principles",
    "description": "The FAIR Principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) are a set of high-level guidelines for optimizing sharing digital resources in a machine-friendly environment. Their growing global acceptance and adoption by policymakers and organizations compels data professionals, projects, and repositories to demonstrate the level of FAIR-compliance (FAIRness) of their digital data, metadata, and infrastructures.\nDespite the straightforward acronym, the FAIR Principles are inherently complex, multi-dimensional, multi-layered, and multi-faceted, involving core concepts with numerous elements (as shown in the figure below). Implementing these principles involves navigating complexities and subjective interpretations. It must also account for domain-specific and application-specific dependencies, such as defining “rich metadata” and its implication to the Copernicus Climate Data catalogue.\nThis presentation takes a deep dive into the complexity of the FAIR Principles, identifies associated quality measures, and highlights several existing tools for evaluating data FAIRness. Dr. Peng will discuss their relevance to the Copernicus Climate Data catalogue, share the insights gained from assessing the FAIR compliance of NASA Earth science data products, and explore how a data catalogue can facilitate and support FAIR-compliance. This sets the stage for broader discussions on strategies to enhance the FAIRness of data products hosted by the Copernicus Climate Data Store and across ECMWF.\n\nhttps://events.ecmwf.int/event/471/",

The course is designed for users who are (or will be) using ECMWF products either directly as forecasting staff or in research and development work. The course aims to help users get maximum benefit from ECMWF's forecast products.\nThe programme combines lectures covering key components of the ECMWF forecasting system and products with interactive, hands-on sessions. Working in small groups alongside expert trainers, participants will analyse case studies to assess forecast performance. Participants will also learn how to effectively use web applications for data visualisation.\nTo ensure participants are well-prepared and able to fully engage with the course content, a set of pre-course activities will be required. These activities, estimated to take up to 8 hours of self-paced study, include completing online e-learning modules, creating a poster showcasing how ECMWF products are currently used in their work, and contributing to online discussion forums. The completion of these tasks will ensure all participants have the knowledge to get the most out of the in-person part of the course and it will also help the trainers to better understand what participants would like to achieve and discuss.\nThis training is in-person, and all lectures will be given in English.\n\nhttps://events.ecmwf.int/event/472/",

    "title": "Informal Seminar: Forecast asymmetries and fragile data flows: challenges and responsibilities for S2S services",
    "description": "\nForecast skill is unevenly distributed across regions and scales, with major implications for the design of sub-seasonal to seasonal (S2S) services. A recent study (Keane et al., accepted) demonstrates a clear crossover in model skill at 5–7 days lead time: mid-latitudes favour short-term, fine-scale forecasts, while tropical regions exhibit higher skill at longer lead times and coarser spatial scales. This pattern holds for both traditional numerical models and machine learning systems (which surprised us), suggesting that it reflects fundamental atmospheric dynamics rather than modelling artefacts.\nA companion study (Dunn-Sigouin et al., accepted) shows that spatial aggregation improves forecast accuracy and extends usable lead time. This is especially true for daily rather than weekly accumulations. I will illustrate these findings using Storm Hans (2023), likely the most expensive weather-related disaster in Norwegian history, to show how aggregation would have improved the usefulness of early warnings for extreme rainfall.\nTogether, these papers point to a need for region-specific forecast strategies. In tropical regions—especially in Africa—this means investing both in improving short-term capabilities and in harnessing the relative strength of longer-range probabilistic forecasts. Yet these efforts face growing headwinds. U.S. budget cuts have disrupted FEWS NET and threaten CHIRPS and key model data streams such as GFS and CFS, on which many African meteorological services depend.\nIn this talk, I will reflect on how these scientific and infrastructural challenges intersect in practice, as well as why ECMWF and European institutions may now be called upon to fill emerging global data gaps and support more equitable access to forecast information.\n\nhttps://events.ecmwf.int/event/481/",

    "title": "Informal Seminar: Assessing the impact of model biases on sub-seasonal forecast skill",
    "description": "Speakers: Frederic Vitart\n\n\nThe impact of model biases on sub-seasonal forecast skill has been evaluated in the ECMWF sub-seasonal forecasting system using a relaxation experiment where the nudging was performed towards bias corrected integrations of the same model. The relaxation was performed regionally or globally but only for the very large scale. Results indicate that this methodology significantly reduces model biases over the areas where the nudging was applied as expected. Experiments with global relaxation or with a relaxation applied only over the North Pole or only over the Tropics display significantly improved forecast skill at a lead time of 3 to 4 weeks, particularly over the northern Extratropics, where sub-seasonal forecast skill has been stagnant at this time range over the past 20 years in the ECMWF operational sub-seasonal forecasting system. Sensitivity experiments indicate that the largest positive impact is obtained with a 2-day relaxation timescale in the Tropics and 5-day in the Extratropics.  An analysis of the North Pole relaxation experiment shows that the polar relaxation impacts biases outside the region of nudging, such as the representation of the sub-tropical jet stream in the ECMWF model, reducing mid-latitude geopotential height bias and leading to a slight improvement in MJO teleconnections over the northern Extratropics. These results indicate that there is a large potential for improving dynamical sub-seasonal forecasting skill in weeks 3 and 4 in Extratropical regions, which could be achieved using online or offline bias correction.\n\nhttps://events.ecmwf.int/event/482/",

    "title": "Informal Seminar: Soil-moisture atmosphere coupling hotspots and their importance for sub-seasonal and seasonal prediction",
    "description": "Speakers: Jonathan Day\n\n\nDue to its inherent long-memory and profound role in modulating surface exchanges of heat and moisture, soil moisture is a major source of potential forecast skill at sub-seasonal and seasonal timescales. In some regions, known as “hotspots”, soil moisture can influence near-surface temperature and precipitation locally, but can also influence remote areas by exciting quasi-stationary Rossby waves in the atmosphere.\nIn this talk I will give an overview of these important predictability mechanisms and discuss a recent study which highlighted the quality of land-surface initial conditions and the current representation of these hotspots as limiting factors in the skill of forecasting systems contributing to the C3S multi-model outlook. Regions where forecasting systems overestimate the strength of soil-moisture atmosphere coupling tend to have particularly low skill.\nI will also discuss ongoing efforts at ECMWF to address these limitations through improved land-surface data assimilation and increased model complexity, as part of the CERISE project. One notable development is the incorporation of time-varying vegetation, which is held static in current operational systems but is thought to provide a source of predictability at seasonal timescales.\n\nhttps://events.ecmwf.int/event/484/",

    "title": "5th ECMWF-ESA Machine Learning Workshop",
    "description": "\nWorkshop motivation and goals\nThe use of Machine Learning (ML) technologies is becoming prevalent in an ever-growing number of applications in Earth System Observation and Prediction (ESOP). Additionally, the scale, complexity and sophistication of the ML technologies applied in ESOP has also increased considerably over the last few years, reflecting the growing uptake of ML ideas in the ESOP communities and benefiting from increased interest of ML domain scientists and of large commercial actors. This trend has reached the stage where end-to-end data-driven workflows are being considered for future operational weather and climate prediction systems. On the other hand, questions remain about the ability of purely data driven methods to advance the science underlying the slow but steady progress of ESOP capabilities based on physics-based algorithms.  \nIn parallel with the scientific developments brought about by ML, at the same time there is a shift in computational platforms for High Performance Computing (HPC) from CPU-based to GPU/TPU-based systems. ML applications benefit from this trend as they are typically developed on GPU/TPU machines, while the process of porting codes currently used for weather and climate prediction to the new computing architectures is laborious. Looking further ahead, even more disruptive technologies are appearing on the horizon, such as quantum, edge, or neuromorphic computing.  \nThe fifth edition of the ECMWF–ESA Workshop on Machine Learning for Earth Observation and Prediction will provide an up-to-date snapshot of the state of the art in this rapidly evolving field and a forum of discussion and interaction among worldwide scientists and practitioners about the current opportunities and challenges presented by the use of ML technologies for ESOP.   \nThematic areas\nContributions are welcome in all areas connected to the application of ML technologies to ESOP applications, with a particular focus on the thematic areas below.     \n\nHybrid ML-Physics based systems for Data Assimilation and Weather and Climate prediction \nEnd-to-end ML systems for Data Assimilation and Weather and Climate Prediction \nMachine Learning applications for Earth system observations \nHigh-performance and new computing technologies for ML applications in ESOP \nMachine Learning for Digital Twins of the Earth system \n\nTimeline\n\n30 June 2025: Announcement \n15 September 2025: Registration and Abstract submission open \n1 December 2025: Abstract submission deadline \n10 January 2026: Notification of Abstract acceptance \n1 March 2026: Registration for in person participation closes \n\n \n\nhttps://events.ecmwf.int/event/488/",

    "title": "WeatherGenerator project internal hackathon",
    "description": "\nThe WeatherGenerator project will host a hackathon to project participants on 27th to 29th August 2025 in Bonn, Germany.\nHackathon aims\nThe Weather Generator team will present the core model of the WeatherGenerator and show the project participants how this model can be leveraged to a downstream application.\nThis will be an in-person hands-on event with the goal that each application can run and fine-tune the model.\nThe hackathon will open with presentations and discussions of the project models, followed by how to run the applications. The work on the applications themselves will then start, which will be clustered around specific topics.\nRegistration to the hackathon will be moderated by the organisers and places are limited.\nProject background and motivation\nThe aim of the WeatherGenerator project is to build an advanced generative Foundation Model of the Earth system – that will serve as a new Digital Twin for Destination Earth. The WeatherGenerator model will be based on representation learning and aims to create a general and versatile tool that models the dynamics of the Earth system based on a large variety of Earth system data. At the same time, it also aims to integrate observations and simulations at a previously unseen level and scale.\nThis project brings together Europe's leading scientific groups and research institutes, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs), and industry partners in the area of Earth system modelling, high-performance computing (HPC) and machine learning to build the WeatherGenerator as a new Digital Twin of DestinE. Once trained, the WeatherGenerator will be applied for selected high-impact applications in the energy, food, water and health sectors. The WeatherGenerator will lead to key innovations in weather and climate science and machine learning to enable Europe to establish and defend leadership with respect to machine-learning based Earth system modelling\nThe WeatherGenerator  project is funded by the European Union, Grant Agreement 101187947.\nMore details on the WeatherGenerator can be found at https://weathergenerator.eu/\n\nhttps://events.ecmwf.int/event/489/",

    "description": "\nBackground \nThe first European Risk Assessment (EUCRA), published by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in March 2024, conducted a structured risk assessment of 36 major climate risks for Europe from various sectors and systems (energy, food security, ecosystems, infrastructure, water resources, financial systems, human health, etc) complemented by risk storylines of selected compound climate risks across systems. The approach and the results of the project were well received by the European Commission and other key stakeholders. The scoping phase of the follow-up (“EUCRA-2”) has just commenced. \nAim of this workshop\nThis first workshop aims to define pathways how DestinE could contribute to EUCRA-2 (e.g., specific products, simulations). A key outcome of the workshop will be a shared understanding on the data, tools, and services that could be provided by DestinE to underpin the next EUCRA. The discussion will be based on the reflection paper for EUCRA-2 that considers the expectation of CLIMA and EEA for EUCRA-2.\nAttendance\nThis event is by invitation only.\nIf you have been invited and would like to attend, please submit the registration form by August 15th, 2025.\nTiming, logistics, organization\nThe workshop will be a 1.5 day event (from mid-day on day 1 to afternoon on day 2) on September 8-9, 2025.

Various explosive cosmic events result from binary stars, as do close double black holes/neutron stars/white dwarfs, type Ia supernovae, X-ray binaries, millisecond pulsars etc. Relying on existing large scientific facilities, classical optical, radio and X-ray observations are discovering increasingly large numbers of such binary stars. A decade ago, the ground-based LIGO/Virgo detected the merging of two stellar-mass binary black holes, opening a new window in gravitational wave astronomy. In the future, with the support of next-generation astronomical instruments, we shall discover many more binary-related celestial objects. Against this backdrop, we convene this conference, inviting all international observers and theoreticians in the field of stellar science to participate in and exchange recent progress related to binary stars and to look forward to future collaboration and development of new directions for research.\n\nConference topics:\n\n1. Binary star interactions: from mass transfer to common envelope evolution.\n2. Supernovae: from progenitor modeling to explosion simulation.\n3. Gravitational wave sources: from double black holes to white dwarfs.\n4. Exotic stars: X-ray binaries, binary pulsars, luminous red novae, hot subdwarfs, cataclysmic variables, symbiotic stars, etc.\n5. Binary population synthesis studies on binary objects.\n6. Binary star observations from large facilities: Gaia, TESS, LAMOST, JWST, FAST, etc.\n\nExplore the Wonders of Lijiang and Beyond\n\nAs we eagerly await your arrival for the conference of “Binary Stars in a New Era”, it is our great pleasure to extend a heartfelt invitation for you to discover the beautiful city of Lijiang.

    "title": "IAU Symposium 402: Massive Stars Across Redshifts",
    "description": "IAU Symposium 402: Massive Stars Across Redshifts in the Era of JWST and Large-Scale Surveys\n\nScientific Motivation\n\nAlthough massive stars are crucial in solving the cosmic puzzle as they are key contributors of ionizing radiation, metals, cosmic rays and dust and, when they die, of neutron stars, black holes, and gravitational waves, many competing factors, are thought to influence their observed properties and challenge our understanding of how these stars evolve and contribute to the Universe.\n\nThe Massive Stars Commission (G2) of the IAU’s Stars and Stellar Physics Division regularly organizes a symposium, typically every 4 years, to present the latest research findings in the field, discuss the status of current research in massive stars, and chart the way forward for future research. The first meeting was in Argentina in 1971, and in the last decade we organized “Massive Stars: from Alpha to Omega” in Greece (2013), “IAUS 329: The Lives and Death Throes of Massive Stars” in New Zealand (2016), and “IAUS 361: Massive Stars Near and Far” in Ireland (2020, postponed to 2022 due to the pandemic).\n\nSince the last symposium organized by the G2 commission (IAUS 361, 2022), the James Webb Space Telescope is dramatically changing our understanding of the early Universe. Important discoveries at high redshift have been made, including galaxies that are too massive for their age, systems with oxygen abundances typical of much later epochs of the Universe, and possible signatures of Pop III stars at z=10. Massive stars, through population synthesis codes,  \nare critical to simulate the evolution and early chemical enrichment of galaxies in the infant Universe, and to analyse the observed spectra of these very high redshift systems.\n\nMany improvements have been made on individual stars, close binaries and population synthesis models.\n\nA better understanding of the impact of massive stars on their surroundings has been achieved and, in addition, analysis techniques are also increasingly sophisticated. These involve accounting for improved or more complete physics, better atomic data, and/or evolving from 1-dimensional to 3D models in the simulations of stellar structure and winds.\n\nDespite the large progress, however, outstanding open questions on massive star evolution and winds remain (e.g. the role of metallicity, true mass loss rates, internal transport mechanisms and magnetic fields to name a few). The view of massive star evolution also needs to be reconciled with the view of the massive star graveyard drawn by gravitational wave experiments. These issues, to be discussed in this symposium, need to be solved to properly account for the role of massive stars across cosmic time, and to maximize the return of empirical datasets and models in the era of JWST and large surveys (SDSS V Mappers, SKA, and Rubin/LSST, among others).\n\nFortunately, the field of massive stars is entering a new era also enabled by large scale spectroscopic surveys. By targeting vast samples of massive stars in the Milky Way and our neighbours the Magellanic Clouds, IACOB, WEAVE, 4MOST, SDSS IV APOGEE, HST-ULLYSES, and VLT-XShootU, as well as complementary observations, will soon enable detailed constraints on theory obtained thanks to quantitative spectroscopic analyses. In addition, new promising research areas are emerging, such as massive-star asteroseismology, that is providing an unprecedented view of their interior. This symposium will enable the experts from complementary communities to gauge the progress that has been made so far and identify areas that still require improvements. Ideas for new technology may also emerge.\n\nVenue and Lodging\n\nIAUS 402 will take place at Hotel Coral y Marina, Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico.",

This event stands as the largest and most comprehensive space festival in the country, uniting companies, startups, academics, and government stakeholders under a singular mission. Since its establishment in 2018, Czech Space Week has evolved into a critical platform designed to accelerate innovation, collaboration, and investment within the Czech and broader European space sectors.\n\n**Core Events and Strategic Focus**\n===================================\n\nThe festival features a curated lineup of events catering to industry professionals and the general public. The flagship **Space2Business** conference showcases collaborative opportunities, technological breakthroughs, and market trends shaping space-related enterprises, both domestically and internationally. Complementing this, the **Copernicus User Forum** convenes experts focusing on Earth observation technologies and their applications, emphasizing the region’s commitment to leveraging space data for environmental and security purposes.\n\nMoreover, Czech Space Week highlights pressing themes such as space defense and international cooperation. A notable seminar titled “Defending European Interests in Space” addresses strategic challenges linked to space security, particularly in light of recent geopolitical tensions. The festival also fosters global dialogue by including sessions aimed at strengthening partnerships with Indo-Pacific space actors.\n\nEmpowering Diversity and Public Engagement\n\nCzech Space Week actively promotes gender diversity through the **Space4Women** initiative. This platform spotlights female leadership and encourages greater inclusion across all space industry levels, from research to entrepreneurship. Public outreach remains vital, with educational workshops, exhibitions, and family-friendly programs designed to inspire youth and engage wider society.\n\nThe week culminates with the elegant **Space Gala**, celebrating achievements and fostering networking among key players in government, industry, and academia. This multifaceted approach ensures that Czech Space Week functions as more than a conference: it serves as a vibrant nexus where innovation meets policy, and science intersects with commerce.\n\n### Czech Republic’s Ascending Role in Space\n\nThe Czech Republic distinguishes itself as one of the most successful newcomers within the European Space Agency, actively contributing to around 500 ESA projects. Its strengths lie in satellite technology, launch vehicle development, and Earth observation missions. Czech companies and subcontractors are highly engaged in these domains, demonstrating a competitive edge alongside Western European nations.\n\nBy hosting such a diverse and well-structured festival, Czech Space Week fortifies the country’s position as a dynamic and influential player in the global space economy.

    "title": "International School on Space Optics ISSO 2025",
    "description": "**ISSO 2025 will take place from 27 – 31 October 2025 at ESA-ESTEC in Noordwijk, the Netherlands.**\n\nWhat is it?\n\nThe International School on Space Optics is an event that targets to serve the community of young engineers and scientists who are already active or have the aspiration to work in the field of Spaceborne Optics. It offers an intensive 5-days immersion program of lectures, design project and visits to space-related facilities. The course can be seen as a “compressed” 1-year class on Space Optics which would have been part of a Master Program in Spaceborne Technologies and Applications. It will allow 360 degrees exposure to all disciplines or optical engineering in space. A Certificate of Attendance will be provided to any participant that has been present consistently throughout the Course.\n\nThe first ISSO was organised as a “Winter College on Space Optics” in February 2015 at the UNESCO International Centre for Theoretical Physics – ICTP within the frame of the “2015-International Year of Light”.  Following this event it was decided to establish the ISSO as a systematic biannual event. In 2017 the ISSO was hosted at ESTEC. In 2019 the ISSO was hosted at ENEA in Rome, Italy. And ISSO 2021 was hosted online.\n\nIn 2025 the School will be held only physically in ESTEC with no option for on-line attendance.\n\nCode of Conduct\n\nThe school organization is committed to providing an environment that is conducive to the free and robust exchange of scientific ideas. This environment requires that all participants be treated with equal consideration and respect. The participants are therefore expected to conduct themselves professionally and respectfully. All forms of bullying, discrimination, and harassment are prohibited. This policy applies to every individual at the event, whether attendee, speaker or other.\n\nHow many people will participate?\n\n80 people will participate in ISSO 2025. The selection is based on merit and expected benefit for the student.\n\nWhy we do it?\n\nEngineers and Scientists working on any discipline of spaceborne optics tend frequently to be very specialised in the narrow field of their first work missing opportunities in serving other disciplines. Also, optical engineers who have not yet engaged in any kind of activity in Space do not have a complete understanding of where their skills could be applied. The school will provide a 360- degree overview of the broad area of Space Optics covering Applications, Instrumentation and Technologies opening hence the horizons and opportunities for the young engineers/scientists to assess better all available opportunities.\n\nISSO is a sister event of the International Conference on Space Optics – ICSO and it is organised biannually in alternative years than ICSO.\n\nThe ICSO proceedings are freely and readily available on the ICSO proceedings site of the SPIE Digital Library.\n\nCEAS Space Journal\n\nThe CEAS Space Journal includes a distinct field on “Optical, Optoelectronics and Photonics” and welcomes papers of ICSO in an extended version of the conference paper including theoretical analysis. Consider an electronic submission through the Journal [website](https://www.springer.com/journal/12567).\n\nHow much will it cost?\n\nThanks to the support of sponsors the fees for the students will be kept to a minimum registration fee.\n\nWho should attend?\n\nYoung engineers or scientists with a background in any field of Optics, Optoelectronics or Photonics. Background should be demonstrated by:\n\n* a Masters or PhD degree in any Optics discipline\n* actively pursuing a PhD in any Optics discipline\n* working as a researcher in any Optics discipline in a university or research centre or industry\n\nWithout having a strict age limit it is expected that the participants will be in generally younger than 40 years old and with limited experience in the field of Space Optics.\n\nCertificate of Attendance\n\nAt the conclusion of the School a “Certificate of Attendance” signed by the School Directors, will be awarded to all students attending the full programme of lectures and visits.\n\nAcademic accreditation\n\nAcademic institutions can recognize the School for its merit. Notice that the University of Padova’s PhD course on Sciences Technologies and Measurements for Space (STMS) [PhD Course – Dottorato | CISAS “G.Colombo” (unipd.it)](https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/QHywCAngcyYm3vt8JPFy) accredits the ISSO with 2 Credit units ([https://www.study.eu/article/what-is-the-ects-european-credit-transfer-and-accumulation-system](https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/fBMqCBgjCQoZ9gUNU6Ib)).\n\nYoung Space Optics Professionals\n\nWhy don’t you ask our “alumnae” for a first hand account of what to expect from attending ISSO. [LinkedIn Link of YSOP.](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/9093885/)",
