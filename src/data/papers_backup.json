    "abstract": "Oxygen production as a by-product from renewable energy-based water electrolysis has great potential to support the clean energy transition. This study reviews the efficiency of electrolysis technologies, oxygen applications, and their environmental and economic impacts. Proton exchange membrane (PEM)-based systems show up to 85 % efficiencies, while transition metal catalysts increase efficiencies to 90 %. Integrating solar photovoltaic systems with electrolysis yields 80 % efficiency despite the challenges of power fluctuations. High-purity oxygen from electrolysis has broad applications, including respiratory therapy in the medical field, aeration in wastewater treatment, and more efficient combustion of fossil fuels in the energy sector, all contributing to reduced carbon emissions. In an industrial context, oxygen supports the efficiency of processes such as welding and chemical oxidation. The novelty of this study lies in the in-depth exploration of the economic opportunities and environmental impacts of oxygen as a by-product. The potential for increased revenue from oxygen could accelerate the adoption of green hydrogen technologies. Key challenges include the cost of oxygen storage and the need for more efficient liquid storage technologies. Further research is recommended to improve the modular design of electrolysis reactors and more stable integration with renewable energy systems. By overcoming these barriers, oxygen from water electrolysis could be a significant innovation for sustainability across sectors.",

    "abstract": "Background: On a future lunar habitat, acquiring needed resources in situ will inevitably come from the Lunar regolith. Biomining, i.e. the use of microorganisms to extract metals from the regolith, is sustainable and energy-efficient, making it highly promising for space exploration applications. Given the extensive use of filamentous fungi in industrial biotechnology, we investigated the ability of the fungus Penicillium simplicissimum to extract metals from the European Astronaut Centre lunar regolith simulant 1 (EAC-1 A), which will be used as the analogue soil at the European Lunar Exploration Laboratory (LUNA) facility at the European Space Agency (ESA) and German Aerospace Centre (DLR) site. Results: Biocompatibility tests demonstrated P. simplicissimum tolerance to high concentrations of EAC-1 A lunar regolith simulant (up to 60%), both on Earth gravity and Lunar simulated gravity via clinorotation. We reveal that a fungal bioleaching setup using low nutrient medium (20% PDB) enables P. simplicissimum to extract metals from EAC-1 A regolith over the course of 2 weeks at room temperature. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis of the leachate revealed the extraction of magnesium (up to 159 mg/L), calcium (151 mg/L), iron (68 mg/L), aluminium (32 mg/L), manganese (3 mg/L) as well as traces of titanium (0.02 mg/L). The recovered metal oxide powder from the leachate, obtained via centrifugation (14,500 g, 4,000 rpm), followed by filtration (0.22 μm) and drying at 60 °C overnight, achieved a promising average of 10 ± 3 g/L. Further analysis via SEM/EDS and XRD confirmed the presence of aluminium [as boehmite (AlO(OH))], magnesium, and iron [possibly as haematite (Fe2O3)] and magnetite [possibly as (Fe3O4)]. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates successful fungal biomining of lunar regolith simulant EAC-1 A and emphasizes the utilization of fungal-based approaches as promising ISRU technologies in future space exploration missions.",

    "abstract": "The objective of the study was to analyse how the integration of Industry 4.0 technologies can promote circular practices within supply chains, aiming for efficiency, transparency and sustainability. The theoretical framework of the research included concepts from Industry 4.0, sustainability, circular supply chains and emerging technologies, underpinning the analysis of the integration of these elements. The research was conducted through a systematic literature review, analysing 28 articles published between 2017 and 2024 that discussed the integration of Industry 4.0 technologies into circular supply chains. The results indicate that the integration of Industry 4.0 technologies predominantly occurs through the paradox of economic growth, efficiency, and technological innovation. This integration aids in promoting circular practices by identifying waste, opportunities for material reuse, tracking waste and by-products and predicting product demand with greater accuracy, among other benefits. The conclusion of the research highlights the importance of sustainability, innovation and interdisciplinary collaboration in driving more efficient and sustainable practices within supply chains. The contributions include the expansion of knowledge on the integration of Industry 4.0 technologies into circular supply chains, the identification of opportunities for future research, the encouragement of interdisciplinarity and collaboration, and the promotion of more efficient and sustainable practices across various sectors of the economy.",

    "abstract": "Accurately tracking space debris and operational satellites is the foundation of the long-term sustainability of space operations. To improve upon some of the inherent limitations of ground radars, a constellation of satellites carrying optical sensors for the surveillance of the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) region is analysed. This analysis aims to understand the performance drivers of such a system in terms of constellation geometry and provide a general methodology for the preliminary design of the system. First, a method for decoupling the design of the optical payload and the constellation geometry while retaining statistically significant results is shown. Using the resulting estimate for the maximum observable distance, an approximate method for computing the coverage of the system is proposed. The expected daily and yearly variation of coverage depending on its own dynamics and the position of the Sun is analysed, showing that it has a small impact on the design process. The dependence of the coverage on constellation parameters such as altitude, inclination and distribution of satellites is investigated through parametric analysis, retrieving an estimate for the Pareto front of the system. Building upon the previous results, a random search method is shown to be effective in finding a design point lying on the Pareto front that is robust to both random satellite loss and deployment strategy. Finally, a reduced budget architecture is proposed to achieve acceptable performance while using only a few tens of satellites. The resulting work answers the problems of estimating and optimising the performance of a distributed system for space-based surveillance of the LEO region, a stepping stone for future cost–benefit analyses for the enhancement of space surveillance networks.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces “Politeconometrics: The Regulatory Confluence Theory,” a novel mathematical framework designed to measure the impact of regulations in the burgeoning space industry. Traditional approaches to regulatory evaluation are inadequate in capturing the complexities of modern space activities. This paper addresses these limitations by proposing Politeconometrics, which combines econometrics, mathematical modeling, and regulatory theory to provide a comprehensive assessment of space regulations. The framework evaluates the efficacy of space regulations in advancing objectives across various jurisdictions, translating legal structures into quantifiable impacts, and identifying regulatory gaps. By incorporating factors like market entry feasibility, regulatory resistance, and industry dynamics, Politeconometrics offers a refined understanding of regulatory outcomes. Through case studies, including New Zealand's space industry and the challenges of International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Spectrum Allocation, the paper demonstrates the practical application of Politeconometrics. The methodology involves data collection, assumption management, application of structural formulae, sensitivity analysis, and scenario simulations to ensure robust and actionable insights. The paper also explores the Regulatory Confluence Theory, which assesses the interconnectedness of regulatory frameworks and their cumulative effects on industry dynamics. This theory, combined with Politeconometrics, addresses the limitations of international space law by offering a dynamic, evidence-based approach to regulatory governance. Despite challenges like data availability and interdisciplinary integration, Politeconometrics and the Regulatory Confluence Theory provide significant advantages over existing methods. They offer a nuanced evaluation of the space industry's regulatory environment, fostering innovation and sustainable development in space activities.",

    "abstract": "The space economy is booming thanks to the increasing investment of government agencies, private companies, and venture capitalists. From the beginning of the New Space era, the array of actors involved in the development of technologies for extra-terrestrial activities has increased, as well as the downstream applications that foster innovations on Earth. Space technologies promote growth and prosperity: they pose challenges and opportunities in terms of sustainability from multiple perspectives. In outer space, several issues can hinder launches or the capabilities of observing and collecting data (e.g., presence of debris, regulatory and legal issues), while there is room to improve the technical and economic efficiency of operations; on Earth, technologies developed to support space missions and satellite data provide support to human development and help monitoring climate change. The literature dealing with space sciences is extremely varied, from materials and physics for the launch of probes, to management of missions, or the coordination of international activities. The aim of this study is to investigate whether and how studies in the space economy area addressed the topic of sustainability through a systematic literature review. This article analyses 254 articles along multiple dimensions, including the three pillars of sustainability and the sustainable development goals. The studies are categorized according to their main locus of research (i.e., in Space and on Earth) and then grouped in thematic clusters. In doing so, this article provides an overview of the state of the art, highlights potential gaps, and proposes fruitful avenues for future research.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Projects are increasingly becoming the key means of benefits realisation through sustainable innovation. Yet, the literature has predominantly focused on the “sustainability of projects”, emphasising traditional project short-term success metrics like time, cost and quality. This narrow perspective falls short of explaining how organisations should leverage sustainable innovation to generate broader project benefits. Our research addresses this gap by taking the recent “sustainability by project” conceptualisation. We answer the questions: (RQ1) “How do projects realise benefits through sustainable innovation?” and (RQ2) What are the drivers and challenges for organisations developing these projects?” Design/methodology/approach: The empirical context is the European Space Economy. We performed a single case study regarding the European Space Agency Business application program, which aims to foster sustainable innovation to realise the benefits to society. Following a grounded theory approach, we conducted and analysed 44 interviews with managers and triangulated them with secondary data. Findings: We build a theoretical framework explaining how projects realise benefits through sustainable innovation. We found that the drivers for benefits realisation are (1) envisioning a common sustainable future and (2) opening to the project ecology. Challenges are (1) struggling to take off sustainable innovation and (2) having a short-sighted view of the future. We also identified the practices and conditions managers consider antecedents of the drivers and challenges. Practical implications: Managers may implement the identified practices to activate key drivers and navigate challenges in achieving project benefits through sustainable innovation. Policymakers could utilise these insights to shape policies that foster a project ecology conducive to sustainable innovation and long-term benefit realisation. Originality/value: Our paper contributes to reconciling sustainable innovation and project benefit realisation. We offer a new empirical-grounded perspective to pivot from the “sustainability of projects” toward the “sustainability by projects”, showing the drivers and challenges for project benefits realisation.",

    "abstract": "The space industry has grown rapidly over the past decade with launches now as frequent as every other day, and as many as 100,000 satellites predicted to be in orbit by 2030. With this, the environmental impact of spacecraft manufacture and launch will continue to rise, and previously overlooked sustainability concerns, including contributions to climate change, become increasingly pressing. A first step to address this must include a holistic understanding of space mission environmental impacts; hence quantifying methods, such as Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), will be important for the future of the industry. Space missions produce unique concerns such as launch emissions to the upper atmosphere and the use of materials not typically covered in standard LCA databases. This has led to the development of space-specific LCA methods such as the Strathclyde Space Systems Database (SSSD). This paper reviews current concerns for sustainability of space missions in both the terrestrial and orbital environments, including carbon emissions, light and radio pollution, ecological impact, in-orbit collisions, and orbit capacity, and considers solutions such as LCA methods in terms of their suitability for use in the space industry. Following the review, it is concluded that LCA is suitable tool for space missions. However, further development is required to encompass all aspects of space sustainability. It is proposed that a holistic method of quantifying impact could be achieved through additional Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) modules, or through metrics such as the Space Sustainability Rating (SSR). These quantifiers can be used for reporting, and to incentivise industry change alongside the use of regulation.",

    "abstract": "Context. Small bodies in Earth-like orbits, the Arjunas, are good targets for scientific exploration, and space mining or in situ resource utilization (ISRU) trials as they enable low-cost missions. The subset of these objects that experience recurrent temporarily captured flyby or orbiter episodes are among the best ranked in terms of accessibility. Only a handful of objects are known to have engaged in such a dynamical behavior. Finding and characterizing more of them may help to expand scientific and commercial research activities in space over the next few decades. Asteroid 2024 PT5 is a recent finding that shows dynamical traits in common with this group. Aims. Here we investigate the orbital context of 2024 PT5 and its spectral and rotational properties. Method. We studied the short-term orbital evolution of 2024 PT5 using direct N-body simulations. We identified its spectral class from the visible reflectance spectrum and used photometric observations to derive its rotational properties. Observational data were obtained with the OSIRIS camera spectrograph at the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias and the Two-meter Twin Telescope. Results. Asteroid 2024 PT5 experiences recurrent co-orbital engagements and episodes in which it has negative geocentric orbital energy while inside a geocentric distance under three Hill radii, which we call quasi-mini-moon events. Its visible spectrum is consistent with that of lunar-like silicates. Photometric data suggest a rotation period âÂ²1 h. Conclusions. The discovery of 2024 PT5 confirms that events resembling temporary captures are relatively frequent and involve objects larger than a few meters, suitable as accessible targets for scientific research activities and demonstrating ISRU technologies.",

The response has been enthusiastic, and hopes are high that CSS will be powerful platforms for expanding the New Space Economy. But for these hopes to be realised, CSS should not only cover their costs, but generate attractive returns on investment and deliver sufficient value to potential users, such as pharmaceutical, energy, and manufacturing companies. Despite their relevance, the users’ perspective is under-investigated. To this end, our research answers, “How do potential users perceive the value of harnessing CSS in their business?” We adopted an explorative mixed-method research approach and sensemake our results with the Value Theory. The research consists of four main phases. 1) Identification of the value streams and potential users based on the review of 114 documents. 2) Investigation of the CSS providers value espoused based on the content analysis of secondary data and 14 interviews with CSS providers. 3) Investigation of the CSS potential users value expected through the semantic webscraping of 46,319 CSS users’ websites and public documents triangulated with 6 interviews with CSS user managers. 4) Comparison of the CSS providers value espoused, and potential users value expected. Overall, we identified and compared 50 CSS value streams from the providers' and users' perspectives and developed an analytical framework to explain them. Our research endows CSS providers with users' value perception and their geographical and sectorial distribution, helping the CSS providers to develop compelling value streams. Our findings offer CSS providers a clear and in-depth overview of the users value expected, who are looking for integrated as-a-service platforms and tight cost control. CSS users benefit from this study's insights on potential CSS value streams and possible future applications of CSS in their business.",

    "abstract": "<p>Increased interest in space exploration demands a shift in the design and manufacturing of space systems. Traditionally, space structures are limited by constraints associated with launch systems that affect cost, volume, and mass. The concept of Factory in Space (FIS) proposes the fabrication of systems in space to circumvent the launch constraints. FIS offers a transition to a circular economy in space by minimizing resource consumption and creating a self-sustaining factory ecosystem. This paper evaluates the role of circular design in FIS. Circular design in FIS leads to a reduction in design complexity and modular designs that could enhance space exploration. Material selection, modular design, design for robustness, and lifecycle thinking are highlighted as factors that influence design for circularity in FIS. Finally, the challenges associated with circularity in FIS are presented</p>",

    "abstract": "This paper argues that space-related STEM initiatives are forming part of a calculative neoliberal governance strategy to promote desirable conduct and manage resistance to private sector space developments. The paper positions NewSpace as a new form of power and knowledge, with STEM education constituting part of a regime of practices used to govern human activities in space in the interests of private corporations. This governance strategy is discussed through three interrelated STEM objectives, including 1) education and inclusion, 2) employability, and 3) encouraging local economic development. In doing so, the paper considers how NewSpace-related STEM programmes are used to ‘colonise the future’: asserting a libertarian capitalist vision for humanity in space whilst legitimising speculative activities here on Earth. In promoting such agendas, local curricular and pedagogical practices, I argue, may become more influenced by these powerful economic interests rather than wider concerns for the public good.",

Analyzing 10,565 posts from 12 agencies (2021–2023), the study uses mixed methods to assess content types, engagement metrics, and focus areas like technology, education, and international collaboration. Findings show that video content and global partnerships boost engagement, while budget size influences communication reach. The study highlights the strategic role of social media in shaping public perceptions of space and offers practical recommendations for agencies to enhance their digital presence and audience engagement.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces and analyses a novel framework composed of Space, Sustainability, and Regionalism (SSR), examining its relevance to space policy. The SSR framework is presented as a triangular model—an analytical construct that captures the interplay between space, sustainability, and regionalism, and enables systematic comparison of regional approaches. The paper validates the framework as a strategic model with examples from European space programmes, such as Galileo and Copernicus, demonstrating how regional cooperation can promote sustainability and technological ambition in space. Although recent geopolitical developments catalysed the adoption of a first EU Space Strategy for Security and Defence, this step outside the traditional civilian domain remains aimed at peaceful purposes and consistent with SSR principles. These shifts in power dynamics and strategic thinking reinforce the value of a normative basis for space policy that prioritises cooperation and sustainability.",

For this reason, this study aims to evaluate the impact of green marketing on brand value and economic, environmental and social sustainability. Using a quantitative and correlational design approach, data was collected from 363 footwear consumers through a structured questionnaire and data was analyzed using the partial least squares structural equation modeling technique. Green product (0.157), green promotion (0.156) and green place (0.605) showed a positive and significant effect; also, brand value showed a positive and significant effect on economic sustainability (0.809), environmental sustainability (0.700) and social sustainability (0.553). These findings suggest that incorporating green practices into product offerings, promotional efforts, and distribution channels not only enhances brand value but also contributes to achieving sustainability goals. This research provides valuable insights for companies seeking to integrate sustainability into their business strategies and attract environmentally conscious consumers.",

    "abstract": "The proliferation of debris in the space environment, congesting the Low Earth Orbit (LEO), constitutes a major challenge to the safety and sustainability of space missions and operations. Policy makers at the national, regional and international levels are developing and implementing frameworks to address the concerns of space debris. The processes require increased coordination and collaboration and are likely to take a number of years before entering into force. However, as the sense of urgency calls for immediate innovative, multi stakeholder solutions with a global scope, private actors from the space industry can fill the current void by undertaking initiatives which would foster voluntary and inclusive action for the long-term sustainability of outer space. The Space Sustainability Rating (SSR) presents a compelling example, with the aim of incentivising space operators to design and implement sustainable space missions and operations while enabling other key stakeholders from the space ecosystem to become part of this collaborative effort. In particular, the SSR provides a new way to support space debris mitigation through a two-pronged approach: (i) It provides a rating system useable by satellite manufacturers and operators informed by transparent and comprehensive assessment to get a clear picture of where a specific mission stands on sustainability and against best practices. (ii) It hosts an action-focused platform in which all actors from the space sector can engage, including throughout the value chain. In other terms, the SSR can serve as an action arm for the implementation of the current and future guidelines for space sustainability. This work depicts how space actors, with a focus on satellite operators, are using the SSR. By showcasing an example of rating process and lessons learned with EnduroSat's Platform-1, it analyses its effectiveness to incentivise space actors to implement sustainable behaviours and lists the benefits they can derive from using the rating system. Furthermore, the experience of satellite operators from the other side is also described. The potential future developments to strengthen the incentive-based mechanism of the SSR are explored, and ultimately how its promotion among stakeholders, and potential spill-over, can lead to a wider adoption of the rating system (for operators, stakeholders from the space ecosystem and policy-makers).",

In a transformative landscape characterized by societal shifts towards environmentally conscious consumer behaviors, the re-evaluation of sustainability marketing strategies is crucial. This need is further amplified by the advent of technologies like augmented reality (AR), which are reshaping market dynamics. This study not only extends the conceptualization of sustainability marketing using AR (SMART) but also proposes a comprehensive measurement scale. This scale is designed to accurately measure consumers’ perceptions of AR-focused sustainability marketing efforts in fostering engagement. Our approach, a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods, involved five studies with n = 1072 consumers across the U.S., U.K., and South Africa. We conceptualize consumers’ perceptions of sustainability marketing using AR (SMART) across six dimensions: social equity, economic development, environmental protection, ethical considerations, regulatory measures, and technological innovation. The findings not only underscore the importance of integrating sustainability practices and new-age technologies (i.e., AR to foster climate-positive consumer engagement) but also offer strategic insights that can help businesses thrive in a climate-change era and meet their sustainability objectives.",

    "abstract": "After decades where human spaceflight missions have been reserved to low Earth orbit, recent years have seen mission proposals and even implemented plans, e.g. with the mission Artemis I, for returning to the lunar surface. SpaceX has published over various media (e.g., its official website, conference presentations, user manual) conceptual information for its reusable Starship to enable human exploration missions to the Martian surface by the end of the decade. The technological and human challenges associated with these plans are daunting. Such a mission at that distance would require excellent system reliability and in-situ-resource utilization on a grand scale, e.g. to produce propellant. The plans contain little details however and have not yet been reviewed concerning their feasibility. In this paper we show significant technological gaps in these plans. Based on estimates and extrapolated data, a mass model as needed to fulfill SpaceX’s plans could not be reproduced and the subsequent trajectory optimization showed that the current plans do not yield a return flight opportunity, due to a too large system mass. Furthermore, significant gaps exist in relevant technologies, e.g. power supply for the Martian surface. It is unlikely that these gaps can be closed until the end of the decade. We recommend several remedies, e.g. stronger international participation to distribute technology development and thus improve feasibility. Overall, with the limited information published by SpaceX about its system and mission scenario and extrapolation from us to fill information gaps, we were not able to find a feasible Mars mission scenario using Starship, even when assuming optimal conditions such as 100% recovery rate of crew consumables during flight.",

Despite its media-presence, commercial space activity in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) has been mostly absent from the management literature. We use considerations that Goodrich et al. had voiced in Business Horizons in 1987 with their piece “Business in Space: The New Frontier” to pick up on earlier thinking around venturing into space, update highlighted themes, and go beyond those. Our article follows the structure set out in 1987 and covers the current state of space commercialization, obstacles to space commercialization, opportunities in space, marketing and managerial implications, and concludes with research avenues. We find that entrepreneurship in space is currently in a phase overcoming many of the previously voiced obstacles, embracing the opportunities that space offers beyond catering to government agencies as main clients. We call this contemporary period for space Transition Space, which is situated between Old government-driven and venture-driven New Space. We argue that space is a critical new context not only for entrepreneurial activity but for entrepreneurship research as well. Our article contributes to the nascent space management literature.",

    "abstract": "The issue of space debris and its impact on space sustainability is a growing concern that requires collective action from all nations. Over the past decade, the number of spacefaring nations has increased, as evidenced by the number of satellites launched by emerging space nations and by an increase in the number of applications for United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UN COPUOS) membership from emerging member states. More recently, there has been an increase in emerging space nations stating their commitment to join the COPUOS Long-term Sustainability (LTS) 2.0 Working Group, as well as nations who have opted to join as signatories to initiatives such as “Net Zero Space” (e.g., Azercosmos, EgSA, GISTDA), and the Artemis Accords (e.g., Nigeria, Rwanda, and Angola). These initiatives share a common goal of promoting the sustainable and responsible use of space to ensure the long-term sustainability of space activities, including: 1) the recognition of the need for sustainable practices; 2) the importance of promoting cooperation in long-term sustainability between all nations; 3) the support of international guidelines and best practices; and 4) the recognition of the increasing role and contribution of emerging space nations. Given the rapid diversification of the space sector, and in accordance with Part C International Cooperation, Capacity-Building and Awareness of the 2019 COPUOS Long Term Sustainability guidelines, many emerging nations continue to face challenges in implementing space debris mitigation and removal measures. The aim of this paper is threefold: 1) showcase examples of emerging space nations who are actively supporting the sustained use of space at a national, regional, and international level, which includes complying with existing binding requirements concerning space debris within national laws; 2) discuss how the Space Sustainability Rating (SSR) provides opportunities for emerging space nations to progress in their efforts to participate in seeking space sustainability; and 3) provide an analysis using the SSR for several missions launched by emerging space nations including recommended steps for increased sustainability in both the design phase and during operations. The study aims to identify potential challenges and opportunities in the adoption of the SSR by emerging space nations, and dispel the perception that sustainable design, operations, and implementation of the LTS guidelines is a barrier for emerging space nations. The selection of nations chosen for the analysis of this paper aims to ensure a representative sample of diverse space market sizes and maturity, with particular consideration given to geographic diversity.",

Successful recycling initiatives, which could encompass all or only parts of space waste management, would facilitate the reuse of materials that would otherwise be discarded. The present study aimed at testing a method for the identification and categorization of space waste to facilitate the definition of effective sorting and recycling operations in space. In more detail, the study investigated the potential of a sustainable, low-cost method based on hyperspectral imaging (HSI), employing HSI sensors operating in two spectral ranges—shortwave infrared (SWIR) and near-infrared (NIR)—to develop a classification model capable of identifying and sorting space waste for recycling. The findings demonstrate the advantages of using HSI techniques to identify, recognize, and classify various materials, thereby presenting a viable approach aligned with the circular model. Moreover, the proposed approach is non-invasive and non-destructive, eliminating the need for chemicals that could harm the environment. The technique may enable the differentiation of potentially valuable space waste from pollutants, contributing to sustainable waste management and the circular economy.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes an integrated architecture for navigation and attitude control of low-cost suborbital launch vehicles, propelled by a solid motor. Single-nozzle, two Degrees-of-Freedom (DoF) Thrust Vector Control (TVC) actuation is adopted. For architecture design purposes, a non-linear, unstable, 6 DoF model for the generic thrust-vector-controlled launcher dynamics and kinematics is deduced, and a linear state-space representation is proposed. The navigation system provides full-state estimates resorting to novel complementary kinematic filters, whose design allows to establish an explicit relation with steady-state Kalman filtering. A globally stable estimation solution is obtained, apart from the singularities arising from the use of Euler angles. The attitude control law is derived from the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) using the state-space models for each linearization point of the reference trajectory, with an integral action (LQI) added to improve robustness and to provide null steady state attitude tracking error. A correction method is proposed to allow for pitch and yaw control in the presence of spinning motion, precluding the need of a supplementary roll control system. The control system is implemented through gain scheduling, resorting to an altitude-based linear parametric varying method. The architecture is implemented in a realistic simulation environment, composed by the 6 DoF non-linear model, the Navigation and Control solutions, and the environmental disturbances, to assess its performance through Monte Carlo simulations. The navigation system is able to provide accurate estimates of the state vector, while the control system satisfies attitude tracking performance and robustness to both external disturbances and model parametric uncertainties.",

    "abstract": "Outer space is often described as a frontier – an unsettled, mysterious or wild place that should be explored and eventually inhabited. The metaphor evokes a pioneer spirit and a sense of freedom, but it is also bound up with violent histories of settler colonialism and social injustice. Although the frontier narrative remains prevalent in political, commercial and media discourses in the United States and elsewhere, we know little about whether the public understands space exploration in this way. We also lack studies about how those working to popularise space exploration and make it comprehensible to a global audience understand and apply the frontier narrative. A long-term ethnographic study of their work shows that their understandings of the space frontier are refracted through everyday forms of sociality and experience that they cultivate near Boca Chica in South Texas, where SpaceX builds and tests Starship prototypes. The labour of imagination performed by SpaceX fans and space creators upends the problematic myth of the frontier and points towards alternative ways of understanding space exploration.",

    "abstract": "The assessment of casualty risks associated with re-entry necessitates a comprehensive analysis of trajectories and the examination of pertinent safety-related quantities such as the ground impact area and ground reaching velocity. In practical scenarios, the presence of uncertainty in input conditions introduces variability in safety-related quantities. Consequently, employing stochastic re-entry trajectory analysis becomes crucial in overcoming the limitations of conventional deterministic analyses. Conducting sensitivity assessments during the break-up phase is imperative to gain more insights into how to manage the variability of safety-related measures. Therefore, this paper conducted a surrogate-based global sensitivity analysis and employed explainability machine learning techniques to unveil the complexities of the relationship between input uncertainty conditions and three key measures: ground-reaching velocity, falling range, and falling time, with the object of interest being the Apollo-type capsule. A three-step polynomial chaos expansion-based strategy was devised to efficiently approximate the discontinuous relationships. The results show that the relationship is characterized by severe discontinuity that separates two modes: low- and high-ground reaching velocity caused by the presence of two distinct trim points, with precautionary measures that should be taken to prevent the occurrence of the latter. From this set of procedures, three key input conditions that significantly affect the safety-related measures were identified, namely, the altitude, pitch rate, and path angle of the capsule during the breakup. Subsequently, explainability techniques were utilized to give suggestions on how to control the input variability and avoid the high ground reaching velocity mode, aiming to achieve more dependable predictions for the three safety parameters mentioned earlier.",

Technological advancements have significantly expanded our capacity to investigate planetary objects beyond our solar system, which exhibit diverse properties including their sizes, compositions, and orbital characteristics. Although understanding the complex chemical-climate responses occurring in planetary-body atmospheres plays a pivotal role in determining potential habitability, much work is still required in this field. To interpret forthcoming spectral measurements obtained from exoplanetary atmospheres, there is a concerted effort to model these worlds. However, model parameters are often inferred from limited data sets. Consequently, laboratory-based atmospheric simulations are necessary for understanding complex gas-phase interactions and to complement atmospheric models through experimental examination of input parameters. In this paper we introduce the new Berlin Atmospheric Simulation Experimental chamber (BASE), present its current capabilities and provide an overview of experimental scenarios with applications ranging from planetary objects in the solar system (e.g. Mars, Venus, Titan) to Earth-like exoplanets.",

    "abstract": "Outer space is infinite, useable planetary orbits are not. This makes the Earth's orbit a unique case of an Area Beyond National Jurisdiction (ABNJ) complex to address, difficult to use in a sustainable and equitable way and almost intractable to regulate at an international level. As of 2023, we remain far from attaining a sustainable orbital environment, and future uses of the Earth's orbits for new satellites constellations appear now increasingly at risk. Adopting a probability-based empirical model to project the growth trajectory of objects in space, this article argues that the sector will cross a 'critical density' threshold within the upcoming years unless strong remedial actions to clear up the orbits are implemented and estimates the potential costs of active debris removal measures. Our findings suggest that orbital sustainability is unlikely to come from technology alone, no matter how advanced or ground-breaking. A long-term solution will necessarily require a radical rewriting of the outdated, often conflicting international regulatory framework, which contributed to creating this debris crisis in the first place, shrinking the Earth's orbit to (almost) the point of no return.",

    "abstract": "In recent years small satellites have shifted from being secondary items to dominate the space market thanks to, but not only, the development of the large LEO constellations. For small satellites to be highly effective, particularly when arranged in such constellations, each satellite has to be placed in a specific orbital plane and orbital position. Currently, three main options are available to reach a specific orbit. The first, more straightforward solution is to employ a dedicated launch with a small launch vehicle. Plenty of small launchers are in development around the world (with few already operational); however, their cost per kilogram is predicted to be much higher than for large launchers. The second possibility is the exploitation of a rideshare option, where the satellite is transported by a large launcher together with other payloads on a general predetermined orbit. Afterwards the satellite needs to be transferred to its designed orbit. This can be done in two ways: through the use of a satellite carrier (also called self-propelled dispenser) or with the satellite own propulsion system. In both last cases, the mass transported by the launcher into the release orbit is higher than the final one necessary for the nominal mission, impacting total costs. In this paper these three possibilities are compared considering the need to reach various specific orbits, starting from a different release one in the case of the rideshare options. First of all, the change in velocity for different orbital parameters (altitude, eccentricity, phase, argument of perigee, inclination, RAAN) is computed. Afterwards the propulsion mass budget is calculated. Everything else being equal, it is demonstrated mathematically that a dispenser is inherently less efficient than a group of autonomous satellites, particularly for the RAAN change and a large number of carried satellites. However, it is not always possible or convenient to provide small satellites, particularly the smallest ones (nanosats/cubesats/microsats) with comparable propulsion capabilities of a larger dispenser, making the latter still an attractive option in several situations. A cost analysis also shows that, particularly for sophisticated small satellites, when the final orbit is far from the release one, a dedicated small launch vehicle can be cost competitive with the nominally much cheaper large launcher.",

    "abstract": "Engagement is fundamental for organizations in complex projects’ ecologies (e.g., space, nuclear, telecommunication) to enact value for their end-users. However, the existing knowledge on this empirical subject has two significant shortcomings. First, while the narrative about project value suffices to explain how a project enacts value for its stakeholders, it falls short of unfolding the enacted value of a complex project for its end-users from a broader economic and societal perspective. Second, while literature effectively explains project stakeholder engagement practices, the role played by other elements of a complex project’ ecology in shaping the engagement practices with end-users remains largely underexplored. This paper aims to explain how organizations in complex projects’ ecologies engage with their end-users to enact the value of complex projects. Leveraging a qualitative and inductive approach, we conducted 31 open interviews with managers of organizations in the European space project ecology, and their end-users. Drawing on a grounded theory approach, we identified four classes of engagement practices. (1) “Personal for value espoused,” adopted by space managers to espouse the value of complex space projects to end-user managers. (2) “Personal for value expected,” adopted by space managers to be engaged by end-user managers and understand their value expectation. (3) “Personal for value enacted,” reinforcing personal relationships and enacting the value of complex space projects over time. (4) “Nonpersonal” engagement practices, adopted by organizations in the complex project ecology toward their end-users. We contribute to the literature on value and engagement by showing that: (1) value enactment occurs through personal engagement and is not only impersonal; (2) form of value (i.e., espoused, expected, and enacted) shapes the engagement of managers and organizations in the complex project ecologies toward their end-users; and (3) a project ecology perspective enhances the understanding of the value of complex projects for end-users.",

    "abstract": "Student-led space initiatives in Germany have witnessed remarkable advancements not only in technology but also in the realm of marketing and outreach. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the impactful marketing strategies employed by German student space societies, particularly focusing on their ability to engage and captivate diverse audiences with minimal budgets. Through a series of compelling case studies, this abstract outline how these societies have leveraged creativity and innovation to gain significant recognition and influence in the field of aerospace. The first case study highlights the creative marketing approach of KSat e.V., a student society renowned for their project that brought the first Gin to the International Space Station (ISS), for solely scientific and technical reasons. This unique endeavour garnered nationwide media recognition in printed media, online, radio and tv, illustrating the power of unconventional and newsworthy stories in capturing public interest. The tactics employed by KSat e.V. navigate media landscapes and create a narrative that not only intrigued the public but also highlighted the society's technical prowess and ingenuity with the creation of \"THE SÄTELLITE\" in context of the county's marketing campaign \"THE LÄND\". WüSpace, a student society, engaged millions of gamers by incorporating a beloved video game character into their sounding rocket experiment. This creative approach not only captured the gaming community's attention but also inspired an interest in space exploration among them. By blending gaming with space science, WüSpace effectively broadened their audience and fuelled a passion for space within a group not typically engaged by such projects. This strategy exemplifies how student societies can tap into popular culture and digital platforms to broaden their reach and appeal to a younger, tech-savvy audience. In addition to these digital approaches, the paper highlights the creative use of regional campaigns like \"THE SÄTELLITE,\" an adaptation of Baden-Württemberg's \"THE LÄND\" initiative, which successfully captured public attention. Furthermore, the paper explores the \"Fly Your Name to Space\" activities, a series of outreach programs aimed at engaging local enthusiasts. These initiatives demonstrate the societies' commitment to inspiring the next generation of aerospace professionals. Operating with zero or very small marketing budgets, these German student space associations have set a benchmark for impactful marketing in the aerospace sector. Their success stories provide invaluable insights into how strategic communication, creative storytelling, and community engagement can be harmoniously blended to achieve remarkable outcomes. These outreach and engagement achievements may serve as a blueprint for other (student-led) organisations seeking to make a significant impact in their fields with limited resources.",

    "abstract": "This timely Handbook offers a detailed cross-policy assessment on the need, locale and impact of regional cooperation and integration, addressing how the principles of regional integration have affected multi-level governance and subsequent public policy. Individual chapters provide explanations of what regional cooperation means in a specific policy area, identify relevant theories, and present empirical evidence to support the arguments outlined. The Handbook of Regional Cooperation and Integration brings together a diverse range of expert contributors who deftly explore regional cooperation across a number of key policy areas, including migration, trade, the digital sphere, finance, security, democracy and higher education. Through a comprehensive analysis of the nature of and need for regional cooperation in today's world, this Handbook argues for greater and more pressing discussions on regional policy, the value of integration and its resulting application in organisations. A crucial text for global governance, international relations and public policy academics and students, this is also an invigorating read for regional studies scholars. The Handbook 's in-depth study of practical applications makes this suitable for public officials in the sector, as well as regional organisation and think tank staff.",

    "abstract": "Within the space sector, the application of Environmental Life Cycle Assessment (E-LCA) is beginning to emerge as a credible and compelling method for scientifically quantifying environmental impacts of space missions. However, E-LCA does not fully align with the concept of triple-bottom-line sustainability, while the combination of all three sustainability dimensions (environment, society, and economy) within a single life cycle study has thus far never been attempted within the space industry. Moving toward a Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA) is, therefore, a logical next step for the space sector to allow these three sustainability dimensions to be addressed. Consequently, this article presents the underlying principles of a new LCSA framework for space missions and demonstrates its applicability for improving system-level design concepts based on the interaction between sustainability dimensions. The framework was formed based on a systematic literature review to analyze the background, issues, and knowledge gaps related to life cycle methodologies, as well as context-specific sustainability aspects. The framework has been implemented within a life cycle database called the Strathclyde Space Systems Database (SSSD). Using the SSSD, the framework was tested on a mission concept called Moon Ice Observation Satellite to demonstrate how changes in the design for a circular economy and other sustainability-based principles will affect the functionality of the mission at the system level. It is envisaged that this framework will enable engineers to create sustainable space systems, technologies, and products that are not only cost-efficient, eco-efficient, and socially responsible, but also ones that can easily justify and evidence their sustainability.

    "abstract": "It seems to be an accepted assumption that human migration into space is inevitable. However, almost 60 years of scientific studies of the effects of space on Earth life suggest this is not a given. Life on Earth evolved in the context of conditions that are unique to Earth and are not duplicated anywhere else in our solar system. The science indicates that life-sustaining conditions on Earth could be the very things that inhibit our ability to live off-Earth. This paper combines 100 years of scientific development of a theory of ecological thermodynamics with classical mechanics theory and analytical models of self-restoring heat engines to explain how the Sun and Earth have evolved into islands of order in the entropy of space. An explanation is provided regarding how naturally occurring conservative force fields engage a diversity of natural resources in semi-reversible cycles that build a high-exergy ecosphere. The science infers that the ability to establish a human settlement in space without Earth-like self-restoring order, capacity, and organization will result in settlement sustainment challenges. Historical evidence of Earth settlements with disrupted ecosystems point to the following possibilities. Supply chains would disappear, market resources would be depleted, advancement in human pursuits would be disrupted, social and governance systems would falter or collapse, human population numbers would decline, genetic diversity in the human genome would be lost, average human individual biomass would decrease, and human knowledge and understanding would be forgotten. What does it mean to have a location in space outside of Earth be “like Earth?” The results of research are presented as a pancosmorio theory of human sustainability that is developed using the scientific philosophy methodology of abductive reasoning. Four analytical models of space ecosphere sustainability and five hypotheses with proposed tests for falsifiability are provided, including a theorem that suggests a limit to human expansion into space. A new quantitative method of human sustainability is developed from theories of network ecology, providing orthogonal properties of an ecosystem network stability function based upon an ecosystem network production function. Conclusions are made regarding the potential for sustainable development in space using balanced sustainability. Insights are provided regarding human endeavors on the Moon and Mars, as well as the Fermi paradox.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the convergence of risk, sustainability, and supply chain in space missions, including a review of fundamental concepts, the introduction of a multi-objective conceptual optimization model, and the presentation of a practical approach. Risks associated with space missions include technical, human, launch, space environment, mission design, budgetary, and political risks. Sustainability considerations must be incorporated into mission planning and execution to ensure the long-term viability of space exploration. The study emphasizes the importance of considering environmental sustainability, resource use, ethical concerns, long-term planning, international collaboration, and public outreach in space missions. It emphasizes the significance of reducing negative environmental consequences, increasing resource use efficiency, and making responsible and ethical actions. The paper offers a multi-objective optimization conceptual model that may be used to evaluate and choose sustainable space mission tactics. This approach considers a variety of elements, including environmental effects, resource utilization, mission cost, and advantages for society. It provides a systematic decision-making approach that examines trade-offs between different criteria and identifies optimal conceptual model solutions that balance risk, sustainability, and supply chain objectives. A practical approach is also offered to demonstrate the use of the multi-criteria optimization conceptual model in a space mission scenario. The practical approach demonstrates how the model can aid in the development of mission strategies that minimize risks, maximize resource consumption, and fit with sustainability goals. Overall, this paper delivers a multi-criteria optimization conceptual model and provides a space mission planning practical approach, as well as an overview of the interaction between risk, sustainability, and supply chain in space mission organization, planning, and execution.",

Carbon taxes are an energy policy tool for substantially carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions reduction. This paper proposes a new strategy to promote the use of renewable energy by enterprises in industrial parks against the backdrop of a carbon tax. Using an evolutionary game model based on life cycle assessment (LCA), this study investigates the impact of dynamic carbon tax mechanisms, fines, and subsidies on the energy choices of industrial park enterprises. This paper's primary contribution is the incorporation of LCA into the evolutionary game model, which facilitates accurate calculation of the carbon tax parameter value. According to the study's findings, the carbon tax rate increases the propensity of enterprises to acquire a high percentage of renewable energy. While there is a negative relationship between fines and the propensity of enterprises to adopt a low proportion of renewable energy, an increase in subsidies decreases the proportion of enterprises that purchase a high proportion of renewable energy. This paper concludes by providing a theoretical foundation for policymakers to construct precise carbon tax schemes and promote renewable energy consumption among industrial park enterprises while simultaneously reducing carbon emissions.",

Large-scale solar arrays are typically located near arable land. However, limited data on the toxicity of perovskite compounds are currently available. This study investigated the effect of potentially hazardous chemicals from Pb-based perovskite solar cells on two crop plants (mungbean and sorghum). The direct exposure of a single chemical (PbI2) in soil media was simulated, a plant soil assay was conducted, and phytotoxicity was subsequently evaluated. After 21 days of exposure, toxicity symptoms in plant growth and physiological responses were observed. The results show that plant root and shoot growth and photosynthetic capacity all remarkably decreased by chemical exposure. Both Pb and I were found to be associated with toxicity symptoms. The reactions of these crop plants to PbI2 exposure indicate the potential phytotoxicity of leachable compounds from Pb-based perovskite solar cells; further, the results obtained in this study will contribute to the assessment of risks associated with the use of these cells in large-scale commercial solar arrays.",

Despite this, the novelty of the concept within space mission design has meant that the approach has not yet been widely implemented. This paper successfully demonstrates this technique for the first time and presents LCE results of three SmallSat missions designed at the University of Strathclyde using the concurrent engineering approach. The Strathclyde Space Systems Database (SSSD) was deployed to calculate the total life cycle impacts of each mission, including the identification of common design hotspots. A novel technique called Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) was also trialled, whereby several impact categories were converted into single scores as a test case to reduce the learning curve for engineers. Overall, the LCE results indicate that the manufacturing & production of the launcher dominate the majority of impact categories. Other common hotspots were found to relate to the use of germanium as a substrate as well as the launch event. As an additional observation, in terms of the behavioural aspects, it was clear that study participants were more open to the concept of LCE with each new concurrent engineering session, evidenced by increasing levels of interaction amongst study participants. These findings are intended to provide industrial stakeholders with a preliminary benchmark relating to the general sustainability footprint of SmallSats, whilst demonstrating the viability of integrating LCE within the concurrent engineering process of space missions.",

Since October 2022, an additional 156 satellites have been added to its constellation, bringing the total number of space assets to 620. This achievement signifies a 98 % completion of the planned OneWeb Gen-1 constellation, that enables high speed and low latency connectivity to high latitude regions worldwide. The full deployment of the constellation is expected to be finalized by mid 2023. As the second world's largest satellite fleet owner and operator, OneWeb prioritizes space safety and sustainability best practices to ensure harmonious co-existence with other space operators within the ever-evolving space environment. Given the substantial increase in the number of space objects over the past two years and the occurrence of fragmentation events, OneWeb aims to share its operational experience and safe navigation methodology of a large satellite fleet from orbit injection to service orbit altitude amid challenges posed by changes in the space environment. The discussion in this paper encompasses various aspects of satellite fleet operations, such as conjunction data management, implementation of space sustainability best practices, and the feasibility and versatility of low thrust electric propulsion systems in satellite maneuverability, environmental pollution reduction and effective collision avoidance efforts.",

In the case of observations with long exposure times and/or wide field of view (FoV), numerous bright tracklets, caused by the reflection of sunlight on a transiting satellite, may appear in the images. For this reason, the Sapienza Space Systems and Space Surveillance Laboratory (S5Lab), which has been involved in research on space debris and space surveillance for many years, started a new research project on the photometric characterization of some satellites of the Starlink project, using red, green and blue filters and comparing the results with observations performed without filters in order to analyze the features of the transit of Starlink satellites. The observations will stress the high complexity of the Starlink satellites reflection pattern, producing interesting results concerned with the used filters and the observation geometry.",

This poses severe challenges to the current international governance of space debris. The existing space debris mitigation guidelines are neither adaptive nor effective in dealing with the space debris problem in the era of large constellations of small satellites. Under such background, it is indispensable to establish an innovative space debris governance mechanism combining rules both concerning space debris mitigation, prevention, and more importantly, space debris active removal. In this regard, China has been improving its domestic space legislation regarding space debris management at the domestic level. On the other hand, China shall continue to promote the innovative development of space debris governance mechanism at the international level, so as to cope with the conundrums resulting from the development of large constellations of small satellites.",

The specific CNES approach with the proposed tool INDIGENE, is to offer the possibility to compare the Space environment impact of a dedicated situation (for example a mission) to a reference model, within a very friendly and intuitive graphic form, and using a wide range of indicators, in addition to physical and orbital based formulations. Relying on pre-existing indices, with inherent pros and cons, the CNES index aims at taking into account - in particular - the constrains related to the French Space Operations Act (FSOA), with the ambition of being used for mission and/or space situation assessments for surveillance, control and regulation purposes. A specific application case will be given in the frame of the current work on the FSOA Technical Regulation update and its future application to space operators.",

Beyond its scientific, technological, and engineering advantages space exploration has created significant direct and indirect socioeconomic benefits. Apart from economic growth, employment, and providing a fiscal contribution, these benefits include cultural, educational, environmental, and social benefits that can be termed community capitals. There are important distributional aspects to these benefits manifested in the way that the space sector is becoming a propulsive industry within the activity complex form of agglomeration economy. In regard to this potential impact on urban and regional economic development, it appears that the space industry can make a significant contribution to realising the policy objectives of levelling up in the United Kingdom (UK) and cohesion policy in the European Union (EU). The agency of this development is the evolution of industrial strategies and policies based upon the concept and practice of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) which evolves its space variant, Space 4.0. This article explores these possibilities from UK and EU perspectives to address the question of whether the space sector is becoming a key propulsive driver of regional policy in general and levelling up in particular.",

    "abstract": "The major objective of this research is to investigate what skill sets\nare desirable to utilize a multiskilled labor force in the construction\nindustry using web scraping and text analytics. The construction\nindustry has been suffering from skilled labor shortages for decades. To\nresolve the shortage and pertinent problems, multiskilled labor\nutilization has been presented in construction. Although extensive\nresearch has been conducted over multiskilling, it is still uncertain\nwhat skill sets are desirable to foster and utilize multiskilled labor\nforce in construction projects. It is also difficult for laborers to\nknow which skill sets will be competitive in the job market. To fill\nthis gap, this research investigated skill sets for multiskilled labor\ndevelopment in the construction industry using web scraping techniques.\nThe results were derived from large data collected over a year. We\nanalyzed texts of construction job advertisements and provided the\ntrends in what skill sets are beneficial for laborers to get employed\nusing text mining techniques with categories from US Bureau of Labor\nStatistics. The results provided construction workers with the\ninformation of what kind of skill sets are required to meet industrial\nneeds. This study provided two types of dual skill sets matrices from\ntext analytics, analyzing only the texts that are essential to job\nadvertisements and analyzing all the texts in job advertisements. The\nresearch also provided an example for multiskilling strategies with the\nmatrices and an additional matrix from professional surveys. This study\nwill contribute to the body of knowledge by identifying high-demand dual\nskill sets and presenting the multiskilling through the data-driven\nanalysis of real construction job market.",

    "abstract": "New industrial dynamics are disrupting the space sector. New stakeholders bringing in capital, technologies, and knowledge from other industries are developing next-generation space infrastructures and services. Both commercial and institutional space projects have to be valuable for a wider set of end-users, asking not only for economic returns but also social and environmental benefits. Space organizations urge understanding and fostering value in the New Space Economy ecosystem. Indeed, end-users are still struggling to enact the expected value of satellite data and solutions for their business. This paper aims to investigate the expected value and the level of adoption (enacted value) of satellite data and satellite-based solutions in the New Space Economy ecosystem from end-users’ perspective. We interviewed 21 managers from end-user organizations in different sectors (i.e., Insurance & Finance, Energy & Utility, Transportation & Logistics). Value is deeply discussed in general management literature, and we identify Value Theory as the theoretical lens with the most explanatory power for the phenomenon under examination. From the end-users’ perspective, we frame the expected value and the enacted value in taking strategic and tactical decisions regarding their activities, services and products, laying the foundations for further studies of value mechanisms in the New Space ecosystem. Our research set a theoretical and conceptual foundation on value in the New Space ecosystem. It also delineates the blurred boundaries of the New Space ecosystem, the main stakeholders involved, and their perception of value. Insights and implications for strategic and innovation management are also provided. Practitioners may exploit our research results and leverage the end-users-oriented framework to develop next-generation space projects in the New Space ecosystem. We also discuss the limitations and further developments of this research.",

    "abstract": "Continuous missions to Low-Earth Orbit, Moon and even Mars missions are the prospect for the coming decades of especially human spaceflight. The actors in these missions are commercial and institutional, public and private. The bandwidth of planned missions is wide, ranging from scientific exploration to commercial exploitation. In-situ resource utilization is planned to support such missions and thus reduce the amount of effort needed for transportation of goods to mission regions, e.g. by supplying water or fuel on the lunar or Martian surface. In the past decades the concept of sustainable development and sustainability has been evolved and became more and more relevant for many aspects of human life and society. These terms have also migrated into more specialized fields such as spaceflight. This paper systematically reviews the concepts of sustainable development and sustainability which have been formulated in a spaceflight context implicitly and explicitly. For this purpose, four perspectives are defined which originate from either Earth or space and alternate with the addressed object between Earth and space as well. It is explained and discussed how these concepts manifest in a spaceflight context, how they evolved over time and which implications result from the respective point of view. Subsequently, the formulation of space in-situ sustainable development is coined and an outlook is given how to further evolve this centric idea to enable a comprehensive evaluation of mission scenarios and roadmaps with regard to their sustainability.",

Social media marketing and marketing management are emerging as key forces in shaping sustainable brand identities, guiding organizations towards responsible business practices and empowering consumers. This research aims to explore the role of social media marketing and marketing management in the development of brand sustainability strategies. A key focus is on identifying how social media engagement and marketing management strategies can shape consumer perceptions of brands and lead to the implementation of sustainable business practices. This research uses a descriptive qualitative approach with data collection through in-depth interviews with marketing, brand management, and social media experts in organizations that have successfully integrated brand sustainability. Document analysis was also conducted to investigate the organization's social media campaigns, marketing materials, and sustainability reports. The results show that social media marketing plays an important role in conveying brand sustainability messages, creating consumer engagement, and building awareness of responsible business practices. Meanwhile, marketing management serves as a catalyst for integrating sustainability values in all aspects of an organization's marketing strategy and operations. Employee engagement and interdepartmental collaboration are key to the successful implementation of a brand's sustainability strategy.",

This work aims to develop a land cover mapping service in geomorphological complex areas in the Aosta Valley in NW Italy, according to the newest European EAGLE legend starting in the year 2020. Sentinel-2 data were processed in the Google Earth Engine, particularly the summer yearly median composite for each band and their standard deviation with multispectral indexes, which were used to perform a k-nearest neighbor classification. To better map some classes, a minimum distance classification involving NDVI and NDRE yearly filtered and regularized stacks were computed to map the agronomical classes. Furthermore, SAR Sentinel-1 SLC data were processed in the SNAP to map urban and water surfaces to improve optical classification. Additionally, deep learning and GIS updated datasets involving urban components were adopted beginning with an aerial orthophoto. GNSS ground truth data were used to define the training and the validation sets. In order to test the effectiveness of the implemented service and its methodology, the overall accuracy was compared to other approaches. A mixed hierarchical approach represented the best solution to effectively map geomorphological complex areas to overcome the remote sensing limitations. In conclusion, this service may help in the implementation of European and local policies concerning land cover surveys both at high spatial and temporal resolutions, empowering the technological transfer in alpine realities.",

This situation can be described as the ‘space sustainability paradox’. This paper presents this concept for the first time and argues that existing policies and remediation actions are not a long-term sustainable solution for tackling this issue and may actually intensify the problem. This places an added importance upon addressing space sustainability in a more coherent, strategic and responsible manner, potentially based on the doughnut economic model of social and planetary boundaries. Doing so may prevent the sector from falling victim to a ‘tragedy of the commons’ type of scenario and avoid negative trends from becoming the norm. As a result, this would ensure that outer space can continue to be used by future generations to address societal challenges, without priming severe and enduring damage to the Earth and space environment.",

    "abstract": "Geocaching is a global game, originated in 2000 and revolving around creating and searching caches in real locations with the use of new technological developments (like geopositioning, beacons, QR codes), therefore combining the real and the virtual worlds. Every year, geocaching enjoys increasing popularity and geocachers can look for caches on all the continents. This should come as no surprise as geocaching is used to promote places, exchange information about the local history, nature etc. Since geocaching is a game with potential to become an effective tool of place marketing communication, a question arises, what factors affect its effectiveness in this respect. The goal of this article is therefore to identify the components of the effectiveness of geocaching used as a tool in place marketing communication. The research was conducted in Poland and combined qualitative research (interviews with managers responsible for official regions’ communication) and quantitative approach (an on-line questionnaire for geocaching players). As a final result, four components of geocaching have emerged which determine the effectiveness of the game as a tool of place marketing communication, namely: Benefits, Engagement, Game structure and Social relations. Management implications: - Geocaching raises interest of the players and place managers where the game happens. - Geocaching combines virtual (technology) and real (outdoor activities) worlds. - Effectiveness of geocaching depends on Benefits, Engagement, Game Structure, Social relations. - Geocaching is seen an attractive tool of place marketing communication.",

The present research utilizes contingency theory to examine sustainable marketing strategies as they relate to consumer perceptions of fit. Multiple methods are used to examine consumer perceptions of sustainability fit. First, a qualitative pretest of 88 MBA students is conducted, followed by a scenario-based survey via an online panel of 546 participants. Additionally, an experiment consisting of 185 consumers provides further evidence of support for the impact of sustainability fit on consumer perceptions and firm performance. Collectively, the results suggest that consumer perceptions of fit are an important antecedent of organizational outcomes.",

The current dominant approach to sustainable marketing is based on a Triple Bottom Line (TBL) profit-centric worldview, which suggests that firms can simultaneously improve their financial well-being as they reduce negative social and ecological externalities. However, whereas the scope of TBL marketing is limited to sustainability initiatives that enhance profits, there is a growing need for—and interest in—developing a sustain-centric approach to marketing that relaxes the need to maximize financial well-being in order to optimize social and ecological well-being. Even so, because of the dominance of the profit-centric worldview, hallmarks of sustain-centric marketing practices remain under-developed and may even lend themselves to becoming inauthentically mimicked on a piecemeal basis by greenwashing profit-centric firms. We provide an exploratory empirical study of marketing practices evident in two sustain-centric firms and draw implications to advance theory for both sustain-centric and profit-centric marketing.",

    "abstract": "The current emergence of a new space economy is leading to the exploration of outer space towards unforeseen futures. Space tourism is a new addition to the tourism industry, prompted in large part by adventure-seeking individualism and potentially lucrative private business prospects. However, in light of the current megatrend of environmentalism, different space tourism activities are facing climate change-related challenges to convince the greater public of their necessity, especially as the high cost involved for suborbital space travel limits it to a niche adventure activity for the wealthy. This article explores the views held by the Finnish populace in relation to space tourism and sustainability through an empirical study. The data are derived from two surveys: the first gathering Finnish public opinion on space tourism’s sustainability with the use of principal component analysis; the second utilising a professional Delphi panel for qualitative explanations. The findings, analysed using grounded theory, can be compressed into four dimensions–“virtual travel”, “comparative fairness”, “technological innovations” and “ecopolitics”–through which actions towards sustainability in space tourism might be enhanced in different national planning strategies.",

    "abstract": "Space activities are now expanding at a fast pace and various ambitious projects have been proposed for the future, raising the question of their environmental sustainability. While the space debris situation has been widely recognized as a serious threat to space sustainability, other pressing environmental issues have received little attention yet, although they pose risks to the environment and actors of the space sector. Therefore, this paper first reviews the major environmental impacts of space activities and their potential growth, analyzed together in a comprehensive approach for the first time. The degradation of the orbital environment with space debris has already reached a threshold leading to a future increase of the number of objects even without additional launches, while the contribution of artificial space objects to night sky brightness may have already crossed the light pollution threshold defined by astronomers. Planned large constellations will likely deteriorate the situation significantly. In this context, the formulation of these thresholds within the planetary boundaries framework is proposed to support awareness-raising and policy-making. Furthermore, stratospheric ozone depletion and climate change resulting from rocket emissions could reach levels triggering regulatory responses in the next decades due to the coming surge in launch rates. This could also apply to particles from thousands of constellations' satellites burning while reentering Earth's atmosphere, although the magnitude of their effects is yet unknown. A common assumption is that limitations to the human enterprise in space are of a purely technical and economic nature. This paper challenges this assumption, by highlighting the existence of environmental limits to the currently planned development of space activities. Risks arising from these limits are explored, and the importance of ecodesign in the space sector is emphasized. Finally, the paper discusses the future sustainability of proposed space projects in the context of global ecological transition.",

It is within this region, and especially in low Earth orbit, where environmental issues are becoming urgent because of the rapid growth of the anthropogenic space object population, including satellite ‘mega-constellations’. In this Perspective, we summarize the case for considering the orbital space around the Earth as an additional ecosystem, subject to the same care and concerns, and the same broad regulations as the oceans and the atmosphere, for example. We rely on the orbital space environment by looking through it, as well as by working within it. Hence, we should consider damage to professional astronomy, public stargazing, and the cultural importance of the sky, as well as the sustainability of commercial, civic, and military activity in space. Damage to the orbital space environment has problematic features in common with other types of environmental issue. First, the observed and predicted damage is incremental and complex, with many contributors. Second, whether or not space is formally and legally seen as a global commons, the growing commercial exploitation of what may seem to be a ‘free’ resource is in fact externalizing the true costs.",

    "abstract": "As actors in the space sector are proposing ever more ambitious plans for the future, it is important to evaluate their consequences on the Earth's environment, which are yet poorly known. To address this gap, this study presents a streamlined Life Cycle Assessment of future space activities over the period from 2022 to 2050 based on plans that would likely drive the environmental impacts of the space sector if they were realised. Large constellations of satellites, space tourism, Moon missions, and space-based solar power were considered in a first scenario, while rocket-based point-to-point travel on Earth and Mars colonisation were also included in two other scenarios. To this aim, the model is based on data from companies' declarations and actual space systems and uses life cycle inventory and impact assessment data from the Strathclyde Space Systems Database. In the first scenario, the study finds that by 2050 proposed plans would lead to an unprecedented surge in the impacts of the space sector (×9 on climate change) and in the number of satellites in orbit (∼112,000, all from large constellations). Ozone depletion from launch events could reach significant levels (6% of annual global impacts), while in a decade emissions of black carbon and aluminium oxide from rockets may alter the radiative balance of the atmosphere as much as present-day global aviation, although these effects are uncertain and poorly understood yet. Moreover, the mass injected into the atmosphere by re-entering artificial objects would become significant (∼27× the natural level for aluminium), while its environmental consequences remain largely unquantified. In the two other scenarios, results indicate that speculative plans of rocket-based point-to-point travel on Earth and Mars colonisation could deplete ozone several times as much as all other human activities combined, while air acidification and climate change could reach several percent of annual global impacts and planetary boundaries. The mitigation of these impacts using low carbon fuels would be limited by supply availability and by the emission of non-CO2 climate forcers and ozone-destroying compounds during launch and re-entry. Consequently, environmental sustainability is identified as a potential limiting factor to the development of intense space activities and to making humanity a multi-planetary species. Furthermore, political and social acceptability could play a major role in the development of recreational space travel since it exacerbates environmental inequalities due to an unparalleled combination of economic inaccessibility and high environmental footprints per passenger. Overall, results strongly suggest that there is a pressing need to include environmental considerations in addition to technical and economic analyses in space projects definition and space systems design.",

    "abstract": "Long-term space sustainability demands effective management and limitation of the growing orbital debris population. Achieving this requires first an improved quantification of environmental risk before proper mitigation can be formulated. A significant contributor to this risk is the creation of debris that is large enough to cause damage to another spacecraft upon impact, small enough to be difficult to track, and prohibitively expensive to remove due to quantity and orbital distribution. Currently, the most effective way to reduce the long-term risk of orbital debris is to prevent its generation in the first place. In line with this, the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requires, as part of their license application processes, compliance with regulations designed to limit the likelihood of events which would generate debris, such as the limitation of the probability of collision with large objects [1]. In this instance, a “large object” is any object exceeding 10 cm in diameter, and the legacy maximum allowable probability of collision is 1.0e-3 per satellite, assessed over its lifetime. To show compliance with this regulation, satellite operators commonly use NASA's Debris Assessment Software (DAS) tool. Historically, DAS has provided adequate means for assessing lifetime collision risk for single-satellite missions operating in low earth orbit (LEO). However, given the rapid increase in the number of spacecraft and large constellations that are being launched into orbit, it is prudent to re-evaluate both the regulation requirement itself, as well as the method by which compliance is determined. This paper explores the origin and intent of the requirement and assesses its efficacy through multiple case studies representing different spacecraft in various orbits. In each case study, the likelihood and impact dimensions of catastrophic fragmentation risk are computed for each spacecraft and then compared to corresponding DAS outputs. Analysis results show that not only does the likelihood of catastrophic fragmentation consistently exceed predictions by DAS, but the environmental impact may also be greatly underestimated for spacecraft more massive than 50 kg.",

Using the wavelet coherence approach, we find significant co-movement concentrated around the eruption of the war in Ukraine, mostly for medium and longer scales, indicating a flight-to-arms phenomenon. The strong co-movement is significant for most of US and European companies. Specifically, the GPR index leads the return and volatility of several US and European companies at medium and longer scales throughout the war period, and its impact is mostly positive. Our findings offer new and interesting implications for multi-horizon market participants such as traders and investors.",

Space Weather Interpreters, another future profession, would analyze space weather situation and give advice to avoid the space weather-originated damage to the social infrastructure in advance. Although researchers have been insisting the possibility that space weather hazard impacts social infrastructures and our life, space weather, as of 2022, has not been broadcast, for instance even on TV news programs. The public are still not aware of space weather and possible associated disasters, which can affect their work and life. Therefore, this paper proposes new professions and new methodology for public outreach in order to educate the public about space weather and the related potential disasters.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous illumination payloads on-board small satellites, i.e. LED (Light-Emitting Diode) boards on CubeSats, can be tracked by ground-based telescopes for optical identification, orbit determination and attitude determination. The concept has been explored through the LEDSAT 1-Unit CubeSat project, conceived by Sapienza University of Rome and University of Michigan, and generalized for implementation on all the satellite form factors and classes. The first CubeSat that was launched with LED-based payloads on-board is WildTrackCube-SIMBA (International Designator code 2021-022 K, NORAD identifier 47 941), conceived by Sapienza University of Rome, Machakos University and University of Nairobi. The spacecraft was launched on March 22, 2021, while LEDSAT has been launched on August 17, 2021. This paper describes the proof of concept of LED boards tracking performed with blue LEDs (449–453 nm) installed on-board the WildTrackCube-SIMBA 1-Unit CubeSat. The observations results provide the identification of the object among the numerous satellites released by the same launcher and the recognition of the flashing pattern and satellite face. The results validate the concept of the usefulness of such payloads on-board small satellite platforms, while the upcoming mission LEDSAT will extend the investigation significance by performing extended operations with an enhanced LED-based payload.",

    "abstract": "The global impacts of the spaceflight industry have historically been viewed as limited in scope, without significant growth, and therefore not requiring regulatory attention. As a result, little scientific attention has been paid to the impacts of rocket launches and space debris reentries on climate and stratospheric ozone. However, the space industry has recently seen revolutionary change and growth with the development of new heavy lift rockets, deployments of large low earth orbit satellite constellations, and the introduction of new space-based data services. As the visibility of a rapidly growing spaceflight industry increases, so will the public's interest to understand how spaceflight affects climate, the role it plays in the broader scope of greenhouse gas emissions, and the global response to climate change. Though recent scientific research has answered a few outstanding questions about spaceflight's climate impacts, science and technology advancements and prospects for growth have raised many more so that, in a relative sense, knowledge of spaceflight's climate impacts has declined. Scientific uncertainties, coupled with increased rocket launches and space debris reentries, mean that a space policy based on the assumption of limited global impacts is no longer appropriate. Policymakers will require a comprehensive assessment of the global consequences of spaceflight in order to make effective and informed decisions to guide spaceflight development in coming decades. Stakeholders across the space industry should recognize the urgency of the need to organize and properly fund a vigorous program of scientific research in order to understand the global impacts of spaceflight. Such a science based policy would forestall unwarranted regulation and ensure regulatory impartiality where regulation is unavoidable.",

We use a laboratory experiment to determine how mechanisms to allocate property rights influence the decentralized management and defense of a CPR. We first vary whether CPR property rights are earned or randomly assigned. Insiders (subjects holding the property rights) decide how much to harvest from the CPR. Outsiders observe the insiders’ harvest and then choose how much to poach from the CPR. We also vary whether insiders have the ability to deter outsiders with costly punishment after observing poaching. We find that insiders who earned the property right were more likely to defend the CPR and impose significantly more punishment, leading to a significant reduction in extreme poaching. However, lower levels of poaching often went unpunished under both earned and assigned rights. While earned property rights can improve the coordinated deterrence of outsiders, they are insufficient to completely eliminate poaching, and conflict between rights-holders and poachers.",

It offers a comprehensive analysis of African governance levels, existing e-governance systems, African challenges relating to e-governance adoption, and how e-governance solutions can assist in realising the continent's development goals. First, the study explores the integral role of good governance in achieving the UN Agenda 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the AU's Agenda 2063 aspirations. Subsequently, the existing African governance structures established at a continental level are described to provide an overview of the frameworks informing governance within Africa. Specific challenges that need to be overcome to ensure good governance are then addressed and the current governance levels in Africa are evaluated. An assessment of e-government readiness levels both globally and within Africa is offered through an examination of the United Nations E-Government Survey from 2018. Specific barriers to e-government, both abroad and within Africa, are then analysed along with the associated risks relating to e-government systems. It then investigates how digital divides and lack of internet connectivity within Africa can be addressed by new technologies and commitments from both terrestrial and space actors. The opportunities afforded by rapidly growing satellite constellations being deployed to increase connectivity levels and reduce the costs thereof are then analysed in detail and the various planned constellations are assessed on a technical level. Lastly, the potential for Earth Observation and remote sensing data to assist with e-governance activities across sectors including healthcare, education, agriculture, water and sanitation, and emergency responses is investigated.",

Whilst the political aspects and subsequent ramifications of these fundamental and critical decisions cannot be underestimated, there exists a technical perspective where digital and IS technology has a role to play in the monitoring of potential solutions, but also an integral element of climate change solutions. We explore these aspects in this editorial article, offering a comprehensive opinion based insight to a multitude of diverse viewpoints that look at the many challenges through a technology lens. It is widely recognized that technology in all its forms, is an important and integral element of the solution, but industry and wider society also view technology as being part of the problem. Increasingly, researchers are referencing the importance of responsible digitalization to eliminate the significant levels of e-waste. The reality is that technology is an integral component of the global efforts to get to net zero, however, its adoption requires pragmatic tradeoffs as we transition from current behaviors to a more climate friendly society.",

At these inter-organizational levels of analysis, Space Race Era activities are characterized as teleologically driven (directed by a centralized agent) and more recent space activities (such as suborbital tourism) as evolution driven (subject to forces of variation, selection, and retention). This definition assumes a continuous (non-dichotomous) definition along three dimensions, depicted as a Cartesian coordinate system, with each orthogonal axis corresponding to the three evolution motor forces. Force components include levels (total amounts from all contributing actors) and robustness (sensitivity to increase or decrease in number of contributing actors) of each. Proxies for the three forces include number and amounts of innovation (for the variation force), funding (for the selection force), and demand (for the retention force). A causal diagram shows the relationship of the proxy variables to market “commercialness” based on two extreme samples cases.",

The degrees of flexibility range from adjustable power only to full control over frequency assignment, routing, beam pointing and beam shape. Furthermore, the current satcom landscape is expected to be governed by highly variable demand, making old and new satellite operators face a new challenge in how to manage demand and capacity. Previous literature has pointed out the similarities of the current satcom market with highly established industries, like Airline or Car Rental, remarking its huge potential for a new Revenue Management strategy. We present two different strategies that can leverage a satcom-adapted Revenue Management framework to lift the revenues of satcom operators by more than 20%. Both strategies are based on monetizing the available capacity through existing customers: either selling more capacity or selling additional products. We outline the complete process: we first detail the general and specific assumptions of each monetizing approach and the pricing optimization strategy employed. We then set up a simulation that contains actual demand data and quantify the benefit of dynamic power allocation in terms of available capacity, compared to fixed-by-design allocation. Finally, we present the results of applying the two mentioned strategies and provide a comparison between them.",

In this framework, artificial intelligence, GIS, geospatial analysis and space assets can play a crucial role. Social media analytics can be used to trigger Earth Observation (EO) satellite acquisitions over potential new areas of human aggregation. Similarly, EO satellites can be used jointly with social media analytics to systematically monitor well-known areas of aggregation (green urban areas, public markets, etc.). The information that can be obtained from the Earth Cognitive System 4 COVID-19 (ECO4CO) are both predictive, aiming to identify possible new clusters of outbreaks, and at the same time supervisorial, by monitoring infrastructures (i.e. traffic jams, parking lots) or specific categories (i.e. teenagers, doctors, teachers, etc.). In this perspective, the technologies described in this paper will allow us to detect critical areas where individuals can be involved in risky aggregation clusters. The ECO4CO data lake will be integrated with ad hoc data obtained by health care structures to understand trends and dynamics, to assess criticalities with respect to medical response and supplies, and to test possibilities useful to tackle potential future emergencies. The System will also provide geographical information on the spread of the infection which will allow an appropriate context-specific public health response to the epidemic.

    "abstract": "As actors in the space sector are proposing ever more ambitious plans for the future, it is important to evaluate their consequences on the Earth's environment, which are yet poorly known. To address this gap, this study presents a streamlined Life Cycle Assessment of future space activities over the period from 2022 to 2050 based on plans that would likely drive the environmental impacts of the space sector if they were realised. Large constellations of satellites, space tourism, Moon missions, and space-based solar power were considered in a first scenario, while rocket-based point-to-point travel on Earth and Mars colonisation were also included in two other scenarios. To this aim, the model is based on data from companies' declarations and actual space systems and uses life cycle inventory and impact assessment data from the Strathclyde Space Systems Database. In the first scenario, the study finds that by 2050 proposed plans would lead to an unprecedented surge in the impacts of the space sector (×9 on climate change) and in the number of satellites in orbit (∼112,000, all from large constellations). Ozone depletion from launch events could reach significant levels (6% of annual global impacts), while in a decade emissions of black carbon and aluminium oxide from rockets may alter the radiative balance of the atmosphere as much as present-day global aviation, although these effects are uncertain and poorly understood yet. Moreover, the mass injected into the atmosphere by re-entering artificial objects would become significant (∼27× the natural level for aluminium), while its environmental consequences remain largely unquantified. In the two other scenarios, results indicate that speculative plans of rocket-based point-to-point travel on Earth and Mars colonisation could deplete ozone several times as much as all other human activities combined, while air acidification and climate change could reach several percent of annual global impacts and planetary boundaries. The mitigation of these impacts using low carbon fuels would be limited by supply availability and by the emission of non-CO2 climate forcers and ozone-destroying compounds during launch and re-entry. Consequently, environmental sustainability is identified as a potential limiting factor to the development of intense space activities and to making humanity a multi-planetary species. Furthermore, political and social acceptability could play a major role in the development of recreational space travel since it exacerbates environmental inequalities due to an unparalleled combination of economic inaccessibility and high environmental footprints per passenger. Overall, results strongly suggest that there is a pressing need to include environmental considerations in addition to technical and economic analyses in space projects definition and space systems design.",

    "abstract": "Orbital space is an economically and socially valuable resource that provides a vast array of satellite communication services for consumers, businesses, scientists, and governments. Among the socially valuable services provided, orbital satellites collect various types of environmental data relating to the earth's surface and atmosphere. These data help scientists monitor and better understand the evolving terrestrial environment. When satellites are launched and undertake missions in orbital space, they create pollution in the form of orbital debris. Orbital debris can, and does, damage or destroy other satellites. National entities that use orbital space pledge to follow voluntary guidelines for minimizing orbital debris, but many do not comply. This noncompliant behavior, along with a substantial increase in the number of satellites in orbit, causes the density of the debris fields in orbit to increase, making it more likely that an increasing number of other satellites will be damaged or destroyed. The limiting case of this process is a “collisional cascade,” which renders an orbit unusable. This scenario is broadly analogous to the effects of human-produced CO2, both in terms of the increasing economic and social costs of environmental damage over time and the difficulty in binding nations to international agreements. Because satellites are vital to monitoring terrestrial conditions and provide unique data on the current state of the global environment, we suggest there is a natural linkage for including orbital space in climate change negotiations. Although this might complicate climate change negotiations, we demonstrate how it could also usefully expand the overall bargaining space, providing new opportunities for agreement.",

    "abstract": "As actors in the space sector are proposing ever more ambitious plans for the future, it is important to evaluate their consequences on the Earth's environment, which are yet poorly known. To address this gap, this study presents a streamlined Life Cycle Assessment of future space activities over the period from 2022 to 2050 based on plans that would likely drive the environmental impacts of the space sector if they were realised. Large constellations of satellites, space tourism, Moon missions, and space-based solar power were considered in a first scenario, while rocket-based point-to-point travel on Earth and Mars colonisation were also included in two other scenarios. To this aim, the model is based on data from companies' declarations and actual space systems and uses life cycle inventory and impact assessment data from the Strathclyde Space Systems Database. In the first scenario, the study finds that by 2050 proposed plans would lead to an unprecedented surge in the impacts of the space sector (×9 on climate change) and in the number of satellites in orbit (∼112,000, all from large constellations). Ozone depletion from launch events could reach significant levels (6% of annual global impacts), while in a decade emissions of black carbon and aluminium oxide from rockets may alter the radiative balance of the atmosphere as much as present-day global aviation, although these effects are uncertain and poorly understood yet. Moreover, the mass injected into the atmosphere by re-entering artificial objects would become significant (∼27× the natural level for aluminium), while its environmental consequences remain largely unquantified. In the two other scenarios, results indicate that speculative plans of rocket-based point-to-point travel on Earth and Mars colonisation could deplete ozone several times as much as all other human activities combined, while air acidification and climate change could reach several percent of annual global impacts and planetary boundaries. The mitigation of these impacts using low carbon fuels would be limited by supply availability and by the emission of non-CO2 climate forcers and ozone-destroying compounds during launch and re-entry. Consequently, environmental sustainability is identified as a potential limiting factor to the development of intense space activities and to making humanity a multi-planetary species. Furthermore, political and social acceptability could play a major role in the development of recreational space travel since it exacerbates environmental inequalities due to an unparalleled combination of economic inaccessibility and high environmental footprints per passenger. Overall, results strongly suggest that there is a pressing need to include environmental considerations in addition to technical and economic analyses in space projects definition and space systems design.",

    "abstract": "Missions requiring autonomous, close-proximity operations of spacecraft, such as On-Orbit Servicing, On-Orbit Assembly and Active Debris Removal, have become a thriving topic in the aerospace research community over the last decades, not only from an economic, operative, and scientific perspective, but also as a mean of ensuring the sustainability of the space environment. These operations involve a variety of technological challenges, most of which are related to the need of autonomous and safe Guidance, Navigation and Control systems. Since the future of these mission scenarios is strictly tied to spacecraft standardisation and modularity, relative navigation employing monocular cameras on servicing platforms to approach targets equipped with artificial markers for pose estimation purposes has drawn great attention. Following this trend, this paper presents an original vision-based pose estimation architecture for relative navigation with respect to passively cooperative targets equipped with ArUco markers. The proposed architecture foresees two operative modes, namely Acquisition and Tracking. The first features ArUco's detection through hue-saturation-value image representation, their identification by reading their built-in code and the computation of the pose without a-priori knowledge. The second, instead, takes advantage of prior pose estimates to speed up the entire processing pipeline. Performance is assessed through an extensive numerical simulation campaign, considering as test scenario the final approach phase of a rendezvous manoeuvre to reach a satellite belonging to a large constellation in Low Earth Orbit, and using the Planet and Asteroid Natural scene Generation Utility tool for realistic synthetic image generation. The dedicated tests on the Acquisition mode show that successful marker detection and pose initialization is achieved from up to 99.76% of the possible relative position and attitude states of the chaser with respect to the target at beginning of the final approach trajectory. As the chaser gets closer to the target, results highlight significant robustness of both operative modes against illumination conditions and uncertainties in the knowledge of camera intrinsic parameters. Overall, the architecture shows pose estimation accuracies up to millimetric and sub-degree levels.",

    "abstract": "Aerosol emissions from spaceflight activities play a small but increasing role in the background stratospheric aerosol population. Rockets used by the global launch industry emit black carbon (BC) particles directly into the stratosphere where they accumulate, absorb solar radiation, and warm the surrounding air. We model the chemical and dynamical response of the atmosphere to northern mid-latitude rocket BC emissions. We initially examine emissions at a rate of 10 Gg per year, which is an order of magnitude larger than current emissions, but consistent with extrapolations of space traffic growth several decades into the future. We also perform runs at 30 and 100 Gg per year in order to better delineate the atmosphere's response to rocket BC emissions. We show that a 10 Gg/yr rocket BC emission increases stratospheric temperatures by as much as 1.5 K in the stratosphere. Changes in global circulation also occur. For example, the annual subtropical jet wind speeds slow down by as much as 5 m/s, while a 10%–20% weakening of the overturning circulation occurs in the northern hemisphere during multiple seasons. Warming temperatures lead to a ozone reduction in the northern hemisphere by as much as 16 DU in some months. The climate response increases in a near linear fashion when looking at larger 30 and 100 Gg emission scenarios. Comparing the amplitude of the atmospheric response using different emission rates provides insight into stratospheric adjustment and feedback mechanisms. Our results show that the stratosphere is sensitive to relatively modest BC injections.",

It is organized around three strategic planning questions: What is the current situation with respect to sustainability and marketing? Where is the marketing discipline going vis-à-vis the SDGs? How can it help achieve these goals? This commentary contends all work in marketing should be considered in light of the SDGs and that marketers can create high-impact research that furthers the SDGs by following the principles of Responsible Research in Business and Management (rrbm.network). It considers sustainability trends, the evolution of the marketing discipline, and the gap between SDGs and marketers’ knowledge about how to achieve them. It briefly outlines current research priorities and progress made by marketing scholars on sustainability issues. Last, it describes ways for marketing scholars to engage in responsible research—that is, research that is useful to society and is credible—thereby contributing to achieving the SDGs and improving individual, organizational, societal, and environmental well-being.",

    "abstract": "The early space governance mechanisms aiming at ensuring peaceful uses of outer space opened the way to a formidable growth in space activities. These policy coordination steps achieved during the height of the Cold War can be regarded as pioneering steps towards ensuring the long-term sustainability of the space domain. Yet threats to the continued safe, secure and sustainable use of outer space have been dramatically increasing over the past decade calling for an evaluation of the existing governance mechanisms. This paper presents the intermediate results of a doctoral research on the emergence and progress of space debris governance mechanisms, the orbital debris issue being considered one of the major threats to space sustainability. An innovative international relations' framework is used drawing upon two studies, namely Peter Haas' [1] seminal work on epistemic communities' influences over international policy coordination and Thomas Weiss and Ramesh Thakur's work [2] on the United Nation's contribution to global governance gaps. The doctoral research findings highlight the essential role of ‘epistemic\" knowledge experts in the emergence and evolution of cooperative steps affecting the debris issue, regarded more widely as illustrations of contributions of the epistemic model to space sustainability governance. The study's timeframe covers governance progress from the 1950s until nowadays. This research also identifies levels of governance progress achieved thanks to epistemic influences and provides avenues of thoughts for overcoming obstacles in international cooperation when national security interests are at stake.",

For two different future scenarios considering planned and already partially installed large satellite constellations this fraction increases to nearly 13%, respectively 40%. For these cases, the anthropogenic injection of several metals prevails the injection by natural sources by far. Considering different ablation products, we find that the anthropogenic injection of aerosols into the atmosphere increases disproportionately. Today, they make up about 1% compared to the injected aerosol mass of natural origin, increasing to 30% and 94% for the two future scenarios, respectively. Considering the injection of atoms, the natural injection is dominant by far. For the two future scenarios, the anthropogenic injection is only at 5%, respectively 15% compared to the annual natural atom injection. The predicted strong increase in anthropogenic injection will make it significant in comparison to the natural injection which can have yet unknown effects on Earth's atmosphere and the terrestrial habitat.",

    "abstract": "The Global Commons – the high seas and the seabed, Antarctica, the atmosphere (including the ozone layer and the climate system), and outer space – have a distinctive status in international relations because these domains play a vital role in ensuring humankind’s survival, the subsistence of the planet, and the intergenerational custodianship of the human heritage. I call global commons law an ‘uncommon’ realm within international law that is composed of principles and practices that dovetail with treaties aimed at protecting humankind. These laws have an atypical purpose and are characterized by a commonality of interests based on the view that safeguarding these domains is in the interests of developing and developed countries alike, with scientists, activists, and international institutions jointly having a convening power to maintain peace. To elaborate on the impact and implications of the global commons law, I explain three of its functions: guardianship of future generations; creation of a comity for peace and peaceful settlement of disputes; and setting norms as the foundation for peaceful relations. These norms in turn have four key objectives: they provide common ground for peace and cooperation; ensure equity between rich and poor countries; create a forum for equitable burden-sharing; and prevent future harm. The Global Commons face threats – melting ice caps, greenhouse gases, and overfishing – that imperil the survival of humanity. This is then the moment to update and strengthen the mechanisms of global commons law.",

    "abstract": "The United Nations has addressed the concept of sustainable development on Earth in a number of global summits and fora for the past 40 years. Extending the concept of sustainability to outer space is a much more recent development, arising from the realization that the Earth's orbital space environment constitutes a finite resource that is being used by an increasing number of space actors that include States, commercial actors and other non-governmental entities. The proliferation of space debris, the increasing complexity of space operations, the emergence of large constellations of satellites, and the increased risks of collisions and interference with the operation of satellites raise concerns about the safety of space operations and the long-term sustainability (LTS) of space activities. Addressing these developments and risks requires international cooperation. The leading international forum to discuss questions of international cooperation in space activities is the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UN COPUOS). In 2010, the Committee began its consideration of this topic with a view to producing a set of internationally agreed guidelines that States could follow to ensure that their space activities would not cause harm to the space environment or the safety of space operations. Following a broad international process conducted under the aegis of COPUOS, in June 2019 the Committee adopted a set of 21 voluntary, non-binding UN COPUOS Guidelines for the Long-term Sustainability of Outer Space Activities (‘COPUOS LTS Guidelines’). This paper provides a brief overview of the development of these guidelines, summarizes the salient features of the guidelines and discusses the implementation of these guidelines from the perspectives of government, industry and civil society. In adopting this set of LTS Guidelines, COPUOS acknowledged that more work needs to be done on this topic and it agreed to establish a follow-up LTS working group with a five-year mandate to continue the work. The main themes and challenges facing the next phase of the LTS discussions in COPUOS are also discussed.",

Moreover, a vital climatic parameter, the temperature has a direct impact on evaporation, frost, and snow melting. Temperature predictions are based mainly on numerical and statistical models. Sometimes it is a challenge to improve the weather forecast accuracy. The article aims to implement a weather prediction technique based on machine learning methods and approaches to improve the hourly air temperature prediction for up to 24 hours in the Ararat valley (Armenia). Due to intense heat and low relative humidity, the high temperatures and hot winds occur between 120 and 160 days per year in Ararat valley, as one of the aridest regions of Armenia. The approach utilizes the earth observation data received from several meteorological stations and the large satellite analysis-ready datasets at different frequencies and resolutions. The experiments have been conducted with multiple neural networks to forecast air temperatures for 24 hours that happened over the Ararat valley. The suggested model has 87.31% and 75.57% accuracies to predict the temperature for the next 3 and 24 hours, which is sufficient to be used alongside the current state-of-the-art techniques.",

The question of where these footprints fall is arbitrated by larger questions of geopolitical power and vulnerability, which means that human engagement with outer space is also a question of environmental justice. On Earth, environmental (in)justice unfolds on multiple scales: local and stratospheric emissions from space launches, the placement of outer space related infrastructure in so-called peripheral places, and the role of power in determining whether the use of such infrastructure aids socio-environmentally constructive or destructive practices. Beyond Earth, the environmental geopolitics are likewise multiscalar, manifesting in contemporary pollution issues such as orbital debris and conservation debates such as planetary protection protocols. The environmental geopolitics of Earth and outer space are inextricably linked by the spatial politics of privilege and the imposition of sacrifice–among people, places, and institutions. This paper explores the concept of outer space environments through classical, critical, environmental, and feminist geopolitical theories.",

The purpose of this article was to describe the discussions held at the First Sustainable Space Economy Workshop held in Finland 2019. The workshop gathered together experts with economic, legal, regulatory, technological, and environmental backgrounds, with an aim of discussing the sustainable use of space from all these perspectives. As an outcome of these discussions, we find that two concepts, satellite sustainability footprint and orbital capacity, should be introduced at an international level. The satellite sustainability footprint measures how likely the satellite stays healthy and operating, without causing risks to self or others. The orbit capacity is essentially an integral of the footprint over an orbit, and it determines how many satellites of different footprints could be launched to the same orbit. In addition, in this article, we discuss how to realize such concepts within the current normative framework. The authors suggest both top-down and bottom-up approaches, necessitating negotiations within an intergovernmental framework and with the relevant space actors. The most important finding of the workshop and this article, however, is that different space-related fields and experts having diverse backgrounds should continuously discuss in a constructive and informal manner to realize the sustainable utilization of space in practice.",

Spaceborne active illumination devices, such as LED payloads, can offer a significant improvement to optical observations, extending the observability interval to the whole eclipse time and performing optimized flash sequences for identification, orbit determination, attitude reconstruction or low data rate communication. The main features of LED panels for optical tracking mounted on small satellites platforms (and with particular regards to nano-satellite platforms) are outlined in this paper, along with the description of the design drivers. The analysis of the performance is referred to Sun-Synchronous (at 700 km of altitude) and International Space Station (400 km) orbits, while the ground segment and the optical link budget reference design relies on a standard university space debris observation station architecture. The paper also outlines the advantages of using different observation techniques and the variety of flashing patterns. The LEDSAT 1U CubeSat, aiming at demonstrating the effectiveness of an LED-based payload for observation and tracking, is used as a study case for examples of the LED payloads and related operations that are reported and described in this paper.",

The fact of there being uncontrolled objects is a problem both for the operational satellites in orbit (avoiding collisions) and for the safety of people on the ground (re-entry objects). Optical systems provide valuable assistance in identifying and monitoring such objects. The Sapienza Space System and Space Surveillance (S5Lab) has been working in this field for years, being able to take advantage of a network of telescopes spread over different continents. This article is focused on the re-entry phase of the object; indeed, the knowledge of the state of the object, in terms of position, velocity, and attitude during the descent, is crucial in order to predict as accurately as possible the impact point on the ground. A procedure to retrieve the light curves of orbiting objects by means of optical data will be shown and a method to obtain the attitude determination from their inversion based on a stochastic optimization (genetic algorithm) will be proposed.",

Scholars have suggested ambitious policy proposals to tackle the tragedy of space debris and assure the sustainability of the Earth’s orbits. Their proposals can be classified into three categories: hierarchical regulations, economic incentives and property rights. All three categories require some form of central coordination. However, there might be an alternative approach to the problem and other potential solutions. Elinor Ostrom suggested that decentralized, polycentric systems are appropriate for governing common-pool resources.

    "abstract": "More than 50 years have passed since 2001: A Space Odyssey debuted in April 1968. In the film, Dr. Heywood Floyd flies to a large artificial gravity space station orbiting Earth aboard a commercial space plane. He then embarks on a commuter flight to the Moon arriving there 25 h later. Today, in this the 52nd anniversary year of the Apollo 11 lunar landing, the images portrayed in 2001 still remain well beyond our capabilities. This article examines key technologies and systems (e.g., in situ resource utilization, fission power, advanced chemical and nuclear propulsion), and supporting orbital infrastructure (providing a propellant and cargo transfer function), that could be developed by industry for both NASA and future commercial ventures over the next 30 years, allowing the operational capabilities presented in 2001 to be achieved, although on a more Spartan scale. Lunar-derived propellants (LDPs) will be essential to developing a reusable lunar transportation system that can allow initial outposts to evolve into settlements supporting a variety of commercial activities. Deposits of icy regolith discovered at the lunar poles can supply the feedstock material needed to produce liquid oxygen (LO2) and liquid hydrogen (LH2) propellants. On the lunar nearside, near the equator, iron oxide-rich volcanic glass beads from vast pyroclastic deposits, together with mare regolith, can provide the feedstock materials to produce lunar-derived LO2 plus other important solar wind implanted (SWI) volatiles, including H2 and helium-3. Megawatt-class fission power systems will be essential for providing continuous \"24/7\"power to processing plants, human settlements and commercial enterprises that develop on the Moon and in orbit. Reusable lunar landing vehicles will provide cargo and passenger \"orbit-to-surface\"access and will also transport LDP to Space Transportation Nodes (STNs) located in lunar polar (LPO) and lunar equatorial orbits (LLO). Reusable space-based, lunar transfer vehicles (LTVs), operating between STNs in low Earth orbit (LEO), LLO, and LPO, and able to refuel with LDPs, offer unique mission capabilities, including short transit time crewed cargo transports. Even commuter flights similar to that portrayed in 2001 appear possible, allowing 1-way trip times to and from the Moon as short as 24 h. The performance of LTVs using both RL10B-2 chemical rockets and a variant of the nuclear thermal rocket (NTR), the LO2-Augmented NTR (LANTR), are examined and compared. If only 1% of the LDP obtained from icy regolith, volcanic glass, and SWI volatile deposits were available for use in lunar orbit, such a supply could support routine commuter flights to the Moon for many thousands of years. This article provides a look ahead at what might be possible in the not too distant future, quantifies the operational characteristics of key in-space and surface technologies and systems, and provides conceptual designs for the various architectural elements discussed.",

Carrying out a comparison of the applications of circular economy models and the space industry's best practice, the article argues that the space sector represents a sort of ‘native environment’ for circular economy and shows how to apply more efficiently those same CE principles down to Earth. Adopting a case-study approach and using evidence from a close-loop system originally conceived for life in a space environment (ESA-MELiSSA for water treatment), this study demonstrates how the space sector is not only fully ‘CE compliant’ but also provides a comprehensive framework to further extend the remit of the CE philosophy. If the world economy is indeed at the onset of a new industrial revolution (the so-called Industry 4.0), the space sector can offer insights on how to this revolution can be made both inclusive and sustainable.",

Moreover, the connections between the Earth and space environments are inadequately taken into account by the adoption of a consumer electronic model applied to space assets. For example, we point out that satellite re-entries from the Starlink mega-constellation alone could deposit more aluminum into Earth’s upper atmosphere than what is done through meteoroids; they could thus become the dominant source of high-altitude alumina. Using simple models, we also show that untracked debris will lead to potentially dangerous on-orbit collisions on a regular basis due to the large number of satellites within mega-constellation orbital shells. The total cross-section of satellites in these constellations also greatly increases the risk of impacts due to meteoroids. De facto orbit occupation by single actors, inadequate regulatory frameworks, and the possibility of free-riding exacerbate these risks. International cooperation is urgently needed, along with a regulatory system that takes into account the effects of tens of thousands of satellites.",

    "abstract": "Interest in orbital debris risk has been on the rise in recent years, as small satellites are launched in accelerating numbers, proposals for large low-Earth orbit (LEO) constellations mature, and the orbital debris population continues to grow. Environmental models are being exercised to predict collisional risk, private equity is now supporting the development of commercial Space Situational Awareness (SSA) and Active Debris Removal (ADR) services, and debris mitigation best practices and licensing guidelines are being updated by industry groups and national administrations. These are all positive responses to an increasingly challenging space operational environment, but as is often the case, we tend to rush to solutions before adequately defining the problem we are trying to solve. The authors propose Space Safety as a simple objective statement for an industry operating in a debris-laden space environment and establish the lethal nontrackable (LNT) debris population as the primary risk to assured operations in space. The authors then make the case that SAA and Space Traffic Management (STM) alone are insufficient responses to collision risk and propose Space Environment Management (SEM), consisting of both debris mitigation and debris remediation, as a critical component of a comprehensive framework the space community can use to assess the efficacy of its efforts and to prioritize the appropriation of its resources. The paper concludes with recommendations for setting priorities and directing the community's efforts and resources.",

    "abstract": "Progress towards the achievement of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in many ways presupposes the utilisation of science, technology and innovation. Many sustainability-oriented projects across industries make use of space-based technologies and services to contribute to the Goals. Among others, satellite-based Earth observation, positioning, navigation and communication services are used in an array of sectors ranging from monitoring environmental conditions and changes to supporting search and rescue missions. In order to illustrate contributions to the SDGs, space agencies and other institutions have aligned their projects to the SDG framework. This study attempts a more holistic, aggregate mapping of such alignments to gauge which SDGs benefit the most and from space-based projects and technologies, as opposed to those benefiting the least. The results demonstrate that the number of contributing projects varies significantly across the Goal spectrum, as does the share of the various technologies involved, with particular focus on industrial development, hunger elimination, and improved healthcare. Nevertheless, the range of application of space-based technologies is wide and highlights the relevance of space to support the transition towards a sustainable future.",

This book develops and tests a theory of interorganizational diffusion in international relations that explains how successful pioneer organizations shape institutional choices in other organizations by affecting the institutional preferences and bargaining strategies of national governments. The author argues that Europe’s foremost regional organization systematically affects institution building abroad, but that such influence varies across different types of organization. Mixing quantitative and qualitative methods, it shows how the EU institutionally strengthens regional organizations through active engagement and by building its own institutions at home. Yet the contractual nature of other regional organizations bounds this causal influence: EU influence makes an identifiable difference primarily in those organizations that, like the EU itself, rest on an open-ended contract. Evidence for these claims is drawn from the statistical analysis of a dataset on the institutionalization of 35 regional organizations in the period from 1950 to 2017, as well as from detailed single and comparative case studies on institutional creation and (non-)change in the Southern African Development Community, Mercosur, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and the North American Free Trade Agreement.",

The research undertaken for this project consists primarily of formal and informal interviews with key actors engaged with outer space who project space into Mexican futures from different perspectives, from enthusiastic involvement in technological advancement as a means of fomenting social and economic progress, to the artistic uses of space and technology as a means of critically reflecting on earthly issues of human relationality and geopolitical power. In addition to interviews, I draw on information gathered from documents, works of art, online discussion groups and attendance at events sponsored by the Mexican Space Agency. I am particularly interested in exploring the implications of the agency's mission to “promote space culture”, as I critically confront anthropological notions of “culture” with the uses of this concept in the public sphere. I am also interested in understanding what is “Mexican” about Mexican space culture, and how national institutions and actors relate to their international counterparts.",

    "abstract": "Asteroid mining has been proposed as an approach to complement Earth-based supplies of rare earth metals and to supply resources in space, such as water. However, existing studies on the economic viability of asteroid mining do not provide much guidance on which technological improvements would be needed for increasing its economic viability. This paper develops a techno-economic analysis of asteroid mining with the objective of providing basic recommendations for future technology development and performance improvements. Both, providing water in space as well as returning platinum to Earth are considered. Starting from first principles of techno-economic analysis, gradually additional economic and technological factors are added to the analysis model. Applied to mining missions involving spacecraft reuse, learning curve effect, and multiple spacecraft, their economic viability is assessed. A sensitivity analysis with respect to throughput rate, spacecraft mass, and resource price is performed. Furthermore, a sample asteroid mining architecture for volatiles based on small CubeSat-class spacecraft is presented. It is concluded that key technological drivers for asteroid mining missions are throughput rate, number of spacecraft per mission, and the rate in which successive missions are conducted. Furthermore, for returning platinum to Earth, market reaction strongly influences its economic viability and it seems to be economically viable only under unlikely conditions.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, several metrics have been proposed to quantify the impact of a mission on the space debris environment. In our previous work, we introduced the environmental capacity as the number and typology of missions that are compatible with the stable evolution of the debris environment. This concept enables the evaluation of the effectiveness of mitigation guidelines by looking at the use of environmental capacity due to existing missions. The current work will investigate how the same concept can also be applied as a tool during the design of a mission, facilitating the comparison of different mission architectures depending on their overall contribution to the debris environment. First, the paper will present the latest updates to the debris index used as a metric of the environment capacity, including the inclusion of a penalisation for objects with low trackability and an improved model for the break-up probability. Then, several application cases will be discussed to demonstrate its use as design driver. First, the relevance of adopting operational best practices (i.e. collision avoidance and disposal manoeuvres) will be studied for different spacecraft classes as a way of quantifying better than required behaviour. Then, the environmental impact of a mission will be analysed considering the case when the mission is realised through a single large satellite or through a constellation of smaller satellites. Finally, different end-of-life scenarios will be assessed to demonstrate the use of the method to discriminate between various technologies on a case-by-case basis. The adoption of passive de-orbiting systems will be compared to conventional disposal through de-orbit burns or operations at lower altitudes to gain insight into how two different options, both compliant to existing guidelines, differ in terms of the resulting environmental impact. Finally, a scenario with active-debris-removal will be considered, showing how the quantification of the impact on the debris environment can support the selection of parameters such as the rendez-vous altitude, based on the expected success rate of the capture and final disposal phase.",

The satellite was launched the 2nd of April 2018, to the International Space Station (ISS) and from there, on the 20th of June 2018, was deployed via the NanoRacks Kaber system into an orbit of 405 km altitude. During the mission, two 2U CubeSats have been released by the mothercraft platform as artificial debris targets, to demonstrate net capture and cameras to be used for vision based navigation. Harpoon capture has been demonstrated by deploying a target and then firing at it a harpoon tethered to the platform. The various phases of the missions have been monitored using relevant telemetry and video cameras, and this paper reports the results of the various demonstrations.",

This article describes how these changes related to new space affect various aspects that are important for the development of EP systems. Starting with a historical overview of the development of space flight and of the technology of EP systems, a number of important missions with EP and the underlying technologies are presented. The focus of our discussion is the technology of the radio frequency ion thruster as a prominent member of the gridded ion engine family. Based on this discussion, we give an overview of important research topics such as the search for alternative propellants, the development of reliable neutralizer concepts based on novel insert materials, as well as promising neutralizer-free propulsion concepts. In addition, aspects of thruster modeling and requirements for test facilities are discussed. Furthermore, we address aspects of space electronics with regard to the development of highly efficient electronic components as well as aspects of electromagnetic compatibility and radiation hardness. This article concludes with a presentation of the interaction of EP systems with the spacecraft.",

    "abstract": "The space industry generates pressures on the environment and strives towards more sustainable activities. Several actors of or related to the European space industry, such as ArianeGroup or and the European Space Agency (ESA), have identified the life cycle assessment methodology (LCA) as the most appropriate methodology to measure and then support the reduction of their environmental impact. While the use of the LCA is being established within the sector, only a limited number of peer-reviewed publications are available. Most of the documents released by the stakeholders can be considered to be grey literature. As the topic has not been properly discussed in the literature, there is an opportunity to bring the initiatives carried out by the space sector in recent years to the public domain. Thus, the present work aims to provide a comprehensive overview of past and present studies following the LCA framework. The review compiles 11 papers, conferences proceedings or technical reports that address the development of the LCA framework and good practices in the sector and 27 documents dedicated to LCA studies. On the one hand, the results highlight the emergence of a common framework regarding LCA practice in Europe. On the other hand, the analysed LCA case studies show a highly heterogeneous goal and scope definition. In this review, research needs and methodological challenges are identified and discussed. Finally, recommendations on how to implement and develop the use of LCA within the space industry are given in view of designing more sustainable space systems and associated missions.",

    "abstract": "A specific criticality index, the collision rate percentage increase, was introduced in 2017 to assess the environmental impact of large satellite constellations in low Earth orbit (LEO). That index was estimated in this paper for various constellation arrangements, ranging in altitude from 800 km to 1400 km. The results obtained clearly show that in the regions of space where the current density of cataloged debris is already significant, such as around 800 km, just one hundred more abandoned satellites would increase the current collision rate by ~10%. In less congested LEO regions, as near 1110 km and 1325 km, a comparable increase in the collision rate could be achieved by a number of abandoned satellites between 200 and 500. Taking into account the new planned constellations from 800 km to 1400 km (consisting of approximately 6000 satellites), an increase by nearly 20–30% of the total collision rate among cataloged objects in LEO might be expected, assuming an immediate spacecraft de-orbiting at the end-of-life, with a success probability of 90%. Of course, a greater number of satellites, as well as a reduced probability of successful disposal, would affect the environment even more negatively. Moreover, if the many disposed satellites were not de-orbited immediately, or in a relatively short time, the collision rate in LEO would further increase, at least in the medium term, unless the satellites do not continue to be controlled and maneuverable until they reenter the atmosphere. As an example, if a thousand satellites were disposed on elliptical orbits between 300 km and 1000 km, the collision rate among cataloged objects in LEO might grow by an additional 30% during the few years needed to decay. That said, even assuming a willingness to endure a maximum 50% increase in the collision rate in LEO among objects greater than 10 cm, in the next 25 years, it is clear that an extended and expanded use of large constellations would be consistent with the environment sustainability only if it were possible to increase the post-mission disposal success probability to at least 95%, and hopefully to 99%. At the same time, the de-orbiting phase should be either quite short or fully controlled, in order to avoid the prolonged presence of several hundred or thousands of abandoned satellites in disposal orbits, further increasing the collision rate in low LEO.",

The Hyperion mission and spacecraft architecture can be the start of the next generation of spacecraft for deep-space, but to truly be the springboard for future deep space transports, it was designed to require no assistance from resupply depots at destination, prioritize human comfort for long duration transits, and have multiple configurations to adjust for the mission. The design is focused around generating artificial gravity by rotating the fixed-distance habitat and variable-distance counterweight about the propellant system in the center (X axis), while each subsystem is individually developed to support this operation. Through various configurations, the Hyperion spacecraft contains the unique ability to adjust to the mission phase for aerobraking and transport needs, making the concept particularly adept at reducing propellant needs, maintaining artificial gravity with minimal power, and keeping the center of mass in line with the thrust vector. This is accomplished using de-spun solar panels, Ion engines for spin-up and orbital maneuvers, an extendable truss for mass balance, and a phased array communication system. Hyperion was designed to meet NASA 2017–18 Revolutionary Aerospace Systems Concepts - Academic Linkage (RASC-AL) requirements of developing an Artificial Gravity Reusable Crewed Deep Space Transport and is expected to cost no more than $3.0B per year over 11 years. It is expected to be operational by 2032.",

In the framework of the EU H2020 ReDSHIFT project, new 3D printed shields were developed for microsatellites protection: (1) a multi-shock panel comprising four equally-spaced 3D printed bumper layers, (2) a two-walls panel with outer bumper layers sandwiching a corrugated core, and (3) a hybrid panel with three equally-spaced bumpers, and a fourth corrugated bumper sandwiched between two of them. These shields were evaluated with respect to their resistance to hypervelocity impacts of mm-size debris expectable in the LEO environment. This paper presents the results of HVI tests carried out at the University of Padova on the proposed panels: debris-shielding properties were evaluated with respect to the damage on targets and witness plates placed behind them. Debris clouds resulting from panels perforation were also observed qualitatively through high-speed imaging. Compared to standard honeycomb panels, all the proposed shields showed improvements in terms of debris shielding.",

Although being constrained to limited time intervals, e.g. when the target is in sunlight and the observatory is in darkness, a debris observatory network distributed over multiple locations can improve the observational interval and favor the data integration for more consistent and significant results. The Sapienza Space Systems and Space Surveillance Laboratory (S5Lab) At Sapienza University of Rome has established Sapienza Space debris Observatory Network (SSON), an international network of optical observatories addressed at debris surveillance. The network is composed of six observatories owned and controlled by Sapienza, plus five observational sites controlled by collaborators (mainly University of Michigan and the University of Bern). The network operations have been carried out during several observations campaign, including the Tiangong-1 space station re-entry campaign performed in support of the Inter-Agency space Debris Committee (IADC). The heterogeneous capabilities of the different observatories represent an advantage for acquiring a wider set of debris monitoring data with different techniques. A strong synergy between our institution and the Italian specialized industry has also revealed to be very productive in the context of the network establishment. The present paper will describe the SSON infrastructure and the opportunities, improvements and future perspectives for research institutions or space industry of this wide observatories network will be discussed.",

The paper presents the derivation of the MDOP (minimum dilution of precision), a parameter that can be used for evaluating the performance of TDOA networks for spacecraft tracking and orbit determination. The MDOP trend with respect to distance, number of stations and target altitude is reported in the paper, as well as examples of applications for network performance evaluation or time precision requirement definitions. The results show how an increase in the baseline enables the inclusion of more impactive improvements on the MDOP and the mean error than an increase in the number of stations. The target altitude is demonstrated as noninfluential for the MDOP trend, making the networks uniformly applicable to lower altitude (launchers and suborbital vehicles) and higher altitude (Low and Medium Earth Orbits satellites) spacecraft.",

    "abstract": "Earth's orbital environment is a common-pool resource which has been largely unregulated since the commencement of human space activity in the 20th century. Satellites – both operational and defunct – as well as upper stage rocket bodies have congested orbital patterns and increased the probability of asset conjunctures. The need to minimize waste in space adds requirements to the governance of space and its uses that are evident in a range of types of policy tools, from laws and regulations and procurement requirements at the national level through international treaties and practices. This paper reviews existing literature and discourse on the state of orbital debris regulations and international practices then maps policy tools utilized by the U.S. to address orbital waste and divides such tools into three categories based on their ability to prevent the accumulation of debris in space, mitigate the effects of debris, and defend against waste in space. Additionally, this analysis examines international treaties and standards that promote sustainable activity in space. Finally, this paper evaluates contemporary discourse on proposed next steps for regulation of the planet's orbital environment and dialogue on the effectiveness of existing orbital debris-related laws, regulations, and international practices. Most laws aimed at minimizing space waste focus on prevention and mitigation. Debris defense policies are limited by economic and technological deficiencies in debris removal capabilities. Advances in policy and technology for monitoring and removing debris in Earth's orbital environment will have great implications on the amount of risk in future human space activity.",

The concept of neighbourhood sustainability is studied and discussed at both geographical and temporal level, employing clustering methods. Marked differences in the elaboration of neighbourhood sustainability-related concepts can be tracked at spatial level and linked to the different socioeconomic, cultural and climatic conditions of the considered geographic areas. A significant temporal evolution of the concept can be also tracked with a focus on specific aspects of the sustainability concept in different periods of time. The analysis can help in defining more rigorous evaluation categories and criteria for neighbourhoods sustainability rating systems: new criteria should be included and an international homogenization is recommended in the definition of a common scheme of macro-categories, as well as local versions of the tools. Finally, the adoption of a dynamic approach, that doesn't stop after the projects realization, is proposed for the evaluation of the sustainability at a neighbourhood scale.",

    "abstract": "Committee of Space Research’s Planetary Protection Policy is a triumph of technocratic governance in the global sphere. The Policy is produced by a group of scientific experts and subsequently enjoys high regard among the scientific and space community. However, as Committee of Space Research is an independent organization without any legal mandate the Planetary Protection Policy is an example of so-called “soft law” or a non-binding international instrument, in short, no one is under any legal obligation to comply with them. The policy is linked to Article IX of the Outer Space Treaty and its provision calling for the avoidance of “harmful contamination” of the Moon and other celestial bodies. While space activities beyond Earth orbit have been the exclusive preserve of government scientific space agencies this has posed little problem. However as private and “non-science” space activities proliferate and begin to spread their reach beyond Earth orbit, the Planetary Protection Policy is being tested. This paper will examine the challenges of developing and maintaining an effective planetary protection regime in this “New Space” era. This will involve looking at the existing policies, as well as the governance framework they sit within. However, it is also necessary to consider and understand the scientific basis not just for the specifics of the policy itself but the necessity of it. Finally, this paper will consider whether a broader “environmental” framework is needed as space activities diversity in type and location.",

The United Nations' 2030 Agenda and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (UN_SDGs) pose new challenges for firms, which have to adjust their operations and strategies to the requirements of SDGs. In this context, this paper aims to develop a methodological framework for evaluating the level of alignment of corporate sustainability reporting practices with the scope of UN_SDGs. Based on disclosure topics from Global Reporting Initiative and a scoring system, an evaluation framework was developed in order to assess the quality of information published in sustainability reports with respect to each UN_SDG. An empirical analysis was performed in a sample of sustainability reports in order to examine the structure and the applicability of the proposed methodological framework. The outcomes of the empirical analysis reflect some implications for future research on the UN_SDG reporting practices.",

    "abstract": "This paper is based on a novel approach towards clean energy production, i.e., space innovative applications toward sustainable development. Specifically, the role of Earth observation (EO) satellites in maximizing renewable energy production is considered to show the enormous potential in exploiting sustainable energy generation plants when the Earth is mapped by satellites to provide some peculiar parameters (e.g., solar irradiance, wind speed, precipitation, climate conditions, geothermal data). In this framework, RETScreen clean energy management software can be used for numerical analysis, such as energy generation and efficiency, prices, emission reductions, financial viability and hazard of various types of renewable-energy and energy-efficient technologies (RETs), based on a large database of satellite parameters. This simplifies initial assessments and provides streamlined processes that enable funders, architects, designers, regulators, etc. to make decisions on future clean energy initiatives. After describing the logic of life cycle analysis of RETScreen, two case studies (Mexicali and Toronto) on multiple technologies power plant are analyzed. The different results obtained, when projecting the two scenarios, showed how the software could be useful in the pre-feasibility phase to discriminate the type of installation not efficient for the selected location or not convenient in terms of internal rate of return (IRR) on equity.",

These coupled consequences of the lack of contextual knowledge from the stakeholders as well as lack of their support in the field necessitates effective stakeholder engagement. However, this integration faces challenges such as limitations of project resources and conflicting interests of the stakeholders. In this sense, project resources can be allocated based on the priorities of the fields of conflicts to facilitate stakeholder engagement of the projects. The goal of this paper is to provide a framework to enhance effectiveness of the stakeholder engagement in projects by systematically ranking the potential conflicts while combining the viewpoints of stakeholders and project management team. For this purpose, we draw on stakeholder theory, value-based management, matrix-based dependency modeling, and Total Quality Management to develop a stakeholder engagement framework while considering fuzzy inputs for reflecting the ambiguities at the project life cycle. The proposed approach is then applied to plan stakeholder engagement in case of a green building project in Iran. Practically, application of the proposed framework facilitates stakeholder engagement for project managers in line with sustainable goals through early assessment of the fields of potential conflicts of interests.",

Indicators of four core concepts (R&D, IP protection, collaboration, and external financing) of the innovation process were built using keywords frequency analysis. These web-based indicators were validated using several indicators built from a classic questionnaire-based survey with the following methods: correlation analysis, multitraits multimethods (MTMM) matrices, and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The results suggest that formative indices built with the questionnaire and web-based indicators measure the same concept, which is not the case when considering the items from the questionnaire separately. Web-based indicators can act either as complements to direct measures or as substitutes for broader measures, notably the importance of R&D and the importance of IP protection, which are normally measured using conventional methods, such as government administrative data or questionnaire-based surveys.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 imposed lockdown has led to a number of temporary environmental side effects (reduced global emissions, cleaner air, less noise), that the climate community has aspired to achieve over a number of decades. However, these benefits have been achieved at a massive cost to welfare and the economy. This commentary draws lessons from the COVID-19 crisis for climate change. It discusses whether there are more sustainable ways of achieving these benefits, as part of a more desirable, low carbon resilient future, in a more planned, inclusive and less disruptive way. In order to achieve this, we argue for a clearer social contract between citizens and the state. We discuss how COVID-19 has demonstrated that behaviours can change abruptly, that these changes come at a cost, that we need a ‘social mandate’ to ensure these changes remain in the long-term, and that science plays an important role in informing this process. We suggest that deliberative engagement mechanisms, such as citizens’ assemblies and juries, could be a powerful way to build a social mandate for climate action post-COVID-19. This would enable behaviour changes to become more accepted, embedded and bearable in the long-term and provide the basis for future climate action.",

They will provide communication to unserved and underserved communities, enable global monitoring of Earth and enhance space observation. Mostly enabled by technology miniaturization, satellite constellations require a coordinated effort to face the technological limits in spacecraft operations and space traffic. At the moment in fact, no cost-effective infrastructure is available to withstand coordinated flight of large fleets of satellites. In order for large constellations to be sustainable, there is the need to efficiently integrate and use them in the current space framework. This review paper provides an overview of the available experience in constellation operations and statistical trends about upcoming constellations at the moment of writing. It highlights also the tools most often proposed in the analyzed works to overcome constellation management issues, such as applications of machine learning/artificial intelligence and resource/infrastructure sharing. As such, it is intended to be a useful resource for both identifying emerging trends in satellite constellations, and enabling technologies still requiring substantial development efforts.",

    "abstract": "The space industry generates pressures on the environment and strives towards more sustainable activities. Several actors of or related to the European space industry, such as ArianeGroup or and the European Space Agency (ESA), have identified the life cycle assessment methodology (LCA) as the most appropriate methodology to measure and then support the reduction of their environmental impact. While the use of the LCA is being established within the sector, only a limited number of peer-reviewed publications are available. Most of the documents released by the stakeholders can be considered to be grey literature. As the topic has not been properly discussed in the literature, there is an opportunity to bring the initiatives carried out by the space sector in recent years to the public domain. Thus, the present work aims to provide a comprehensive overview of past and present studies following the LCA framework. The review compiles 11 papers, conferences proceedings or technical reports that address the development of the LCA framework and good practices in the sector and 27 documents dedicated to LCA studies. On the one hand, the results highlight the emergence of a common framework regarding LCA practice in Europe. On the other hand, the analysed LCA case studies show a highly heterogeneous goal and scope definition. In this review, research needs and methodological challenges are identified and discussed. Finally, recommendations on how to implement and develop the use of LCA within the space industry are given in view of designing more sustainable space systems and associated missions.",

The results obtained clearly show that in the regions of space where the current density of cataloged debris is already significant, such as around 800 km, just one hundred more abandoned satellites would increase the current collision rate by ~10%. In less congested LEO regions, as near 1110 km and 1325 km, a comparable increase in the collision rate could be achieved by a number of abandoned satellites between 200 and 500. Taking into account the new planned constellations from 800 km to 1400 km (consisting of approximately 6000 satellites), an increase by nearly 20–30% of the total collision rate among cataloged objects in LEO might be expected, assuming an immediate spacecraft de-orbiting at the end-of-life, with a success probability of 90%. Of course, a greater number of satellites, as well as a reduced probability of successful disposal, would affect the environment even more negatively. Moreover, if the many disposed satellites were not de-orbited immediately, or in a relatively short time, the collision rate in LEO would further increase, at least in the medium term, unless the satellites do not continue to be controlled and maneuverable until they reenter the atmosphere. As an example, if a thousand satellites were disposed on elliptical orbits between 300 km and 1000 km, the collision rate among cataloged objects in LEO might grow by an additional 30% during the few years needed to decay. That said, even assuming a willingness to endure a maximum 50% increase in the collision rate in LEO among objects greater than 10 cm, in the next 25 years, it is clear that an extended and expanded use of large constellations would be consistent with the environment sustainability only if it were possible to increase the post-mission disposal success probability to at least 95%, and hopefully to 99%. At the same time, the de-orbiting phase should be either quite short or fully controlled, in order to avoid the prolonged presence of several hundred or thousands of abandoned satellites in disposal orbits, further increasing the collision rate in low LEO.",

    "abstract": "Until two decades ago, the dominance of the space industry by national governments shaped the key characteristics of the spacecraft population and hence the space debris models used to anticipate future orbital populations. The rise of `NewSpace’ with the growth of private sector involvement has brought innovations, disrupting the status quo and changing to the physical characteristics and mission orbits of commercial spacecraft. Analysis of shifts in mass and launch traffic for spacecraft launched between 1980 and 2019 (source: ESA's DISCOS database) suggests significant impacts for debris modelling. Results emphasised the ongoing change towards a more commercially focused space sector. 742 spacecraft were launched in the 1980s, of which 34 were labelled as commercial. By contrast, there were 1292 commercial missions out of 2325 launched in the 2010s - an increase from 4.6% to 55.6%. These increases correlate with a rise in the number of different organisations operating spacecraft and a clear trend can be seen towards smaller, lower mass spacecraft. This is likely to alter the distributions of fragments generated in collisions compared with the distributions obtained from empirical methods, such as the NASA Standard Breakup model, derived from the fragmentation of larger spacecraft in the 600-1,000 kg range. A study of observed breakup events indicates that the NASA Standard Breakup Model over-estimates the number of large debris released during fragmentations due to collisions or explosion of satellites while also under-estimating the number of small debris. It is believed that this will have a significant impact on the outcomes of simulations of the future debris environment where these fragmentation modes are expected to dominate the generation of new debris over the propulsion based explosions which have been historically prevalent.",

    "abstract": "The space industry generates pressures on the environment and strives towards more sustainable activities. Several actors of or related to the European space industry, such as ArianeGroup or and the European Space Agency (ESA), have identified the life cycle assessment methodology (LCA) as the most appropriate methodology to measure and then support the reduction of their environmental impact. While the use of the LCA is being established within the sector, only a limited number of peer-reviewed publications are available. Most of the documents released by the stakeholders can be considered to be grey literature. As the topic has not been properly discussed in the literature, there is an opportunity to bring the initiatives carried out by the space sector in recent years to the public domain. Thus, the present work aims to provide a comprehensive overview of past and present studies following the LCA framework. The review compiles 11 papers, conferences proceedings or technical reports that address the development of the LCA framework and good practices in the sector and 27 documents dedicated to LCA studies. On the one hand, the results highlight the emergence of a common framework regarding LCA practice in Europe. On the other hand, the analysed LCA case studies show a highly heterogeneous goal and scope definition. In this review, research needs and methodological challenges are identified and discussed. Finally, recommendations on how to implement and develop the use of LCA within the space industry are given in view of designing more sustainable space systems and associated missions.",

    "abstract": "Constellations of satellites are being proposed in large numbers; most of them are expected to be in orbit within the next decade. They will provide communication to unserved and underserved communities, enable global monitoring of Earth and enhance space observation. Mostly enabled by technology miniaturization, satellite constellations require a coordinated effort to face the technological limits in spacecraft operations and space traffic. At the moment in fact, no cost-effective infrastructure is available to withstand coordinated flight of large fleets of satellites. In order for large constellations to be sustainable, there is the need to efficiently integrate and use them in the current space framework. This review paper provides an overview of the available experience in constellation operations and statistical trends about upcoming constellations at the moment of writing. It highlights also the tools most often proposed in the analyzed works to overcome constellation management issues, such as applications of machine learning/artificial intelligence and resource/infrastructure sharing. As such, it is intended to be a useful resource for both identifying emerging trends in satellite constellations, and enabling technologies still requiring substantial development efforts.",

    "abstract": "The fast motion of low earth orbit (LEO) satellite contributes to the geometric diversity, allowing for rapid convergence of precise point positioning (PPP). In this contribution, we investigate the PPP performance of the LEO constellation-augmented full operational capability (FOC) multi-GNSS. We design six LEO constellations with different satellite numbers, orbit altitudes and orbit types, together with the FOC multi-GNSS constellations, and then simulate both the onboard LEO and ground-based observations. The multi-GNSS POD result shows much better orbit accuracy of 3.3, 2.7 and 2.6 cm in radial, along-track and cross-track components, respectively, compared with that of 10.3, 9.2 and 8.9 cm for GPS-only POD. Furthermore, the performance of LEO-augmented multi-GNSS PPP is evaluated. With the augmentation of 60-, 96-, 192- and 288-satellite LEO constellation, the multi-GNSS PPP convergence time can be shortened from 9.6 to 7.0, 3.2, 2.1 and 1.3 min, respectively, in midlatitude region. For LEO-augmented GPS- and BDS-only PPP, the improvement is more significant with the convergence time dramatically shortened by 90% from about 25 to within 3 min with 192- or 288-satellite constellation. The augmentation capability is also found to be associated with station latitude, and the higher latitude, the better performance. To enable about more than 70% significant reduction on convergence time, as well as considering the cost, the 192-satellite LEO constellation scheme is suggested. In terms of orbit altitude, the scheme of 1000 km presents better performance than that of 600 km. As for orbit type, the performances are comparable for polar and sun-synchronous orbits. Additionally, LEO-only PPP can be achieved with the convergence time of about 6.5 min.",

This paper examines the burgeoning space tourism industry in relation to the Anthropocene. The development of outer space has significant implications for Earth's inhabitants, yet only a small cadre of individuals, companies, and governments are involved in this process. Space tourism provides a germane context for conceptualising the ongoing debates regarding the extent to which Anthropos - humankind as an undifferentiated, unitary geological force - is responsible for the impacts that have culminated in the Anthropocene. We apply the Capitalocene framework to elucidate how the factors that brought the Anthropocene to fruition are now extending beyond Earth.",

    "abstract": "A critical discussion is reemerging in space policy, economics, and law: on the classification, use and possible ownership of space resources, and the governance of these activities in terms of rules and institutions. The US legislation from 2015, recognizing the right of US citizens to all asteroid resources they obtain, clearly signals that “money time” has come, in every meaning. Planetary Resources, Inc. has declared this new legislation “the single greatest recognition of property rights in history”. Yet, the discourse on space resources, which are widely—but not necessarily duly—regarded as “commons”, is unstructured and crippled by the confusion of the notion and essence of “commons” between the economic and the legal meanings. This article provides a critical analysis of the “commons” feature of outer space and outer space resources, based on economic analysis and legal theory. More importantly, this article seeks to provide the structure for this important discourse. The first critical step is to distinguish between (i) commons as an economic term and (ii) commons as a legal regime. The first refers to a type of goods or resource used by multiple users, and the second refers to a property rights regime, the ownership over the resource. A mistake, often made, is the confusion between the economic notion of “commons” and the legal sense of the same concept. An “economic commons”, such as a lake, may have different property rights regimes as it may be private property, government property, or “legal commons”. The second critical differentiation is between the different parts of space (e.g. orbits, celestial bodies, and void space) because some may be “commons” (economic and/or legal) while others may not. Asking whether “space” is commons wrongly puts numerous things in a single basket is a sweeping generalization and, in the economic sense, utterly meaningless. Another important distinction is between resource systems and resource units. If we get the questions wrong, i.e. by confusing the terms and mixing different subjects of inquiry, we will not, by definition, find the right answers. Furthermore, the article demonstrates that the notion of “global commons”, often applied to outer space, is of limited or unclear meaning, and it does not imply the property rights regimes in the domains and resources it presumably describes, including outer space. The article opens with making the aforementioned three distinctions in section two. Sections three and five present, separately, the economic and legal notions of “commons” and examine whether some parts of space qualify as economic and/or legal commons, whereas section four presents the limitations of the notion of “global commons”, thus leading to section five. The article concludes by connecting the economic and legal discussions to the search for appropriate governance models for each part of space. As the article demonstrates, the real questions in the discourse are much more complex than “is space commons?”. Although this article provides preliminary answers to the questions it raises, its main contribution is the reshaping of the question(s) currently being asked and the structuring of the discourse on space resources and their governance.",

The current COSPAR Planetary Protection Policy address scientific space exploration only and is primarily concerned with the issue of contamination with micro-organisms. Other impacts of human space exploration that may be detrimental to space exploration itself are not covered. The best known example is the anthropogenic space debris orbiting Earth, but similar problems will occur in other places due to scientific and commercial space exploration in the near future. One possible approach to discuss and mitigate the impact of space exploration on the environment is to consider the space environment as integral part of sustainable development. The resulting concept of “planetary sustainability” and its ethical, scientific, economic, and legal ramifications were discussed during a workshop co-sponsored by the International Space Science Institute in March 2018. In this paper, we first summarize the results of this workshop. Then we propose potential implications of this concept for space research and report reactions and suggestions by members of the space research community during the COSPAR assembly 2018.",

An analysis of 52 articles published in Strategic Management Journal revealed that none of them were sufficiently transparent to allow for exact replication, empirical replication, or conceptual replication. We offer 12 transparency criteria, and behaviorally-anchored ratings scales to measure them, that can be used by authors as they plan and conduct qualitative research as well as by journal reviewers and editors when they evaluate the transparency of submitted manuscripts. We hope our article will serve as a catalyst for improving the degree of transparency and replicability of future qualitative research. Managerial Summary: If organizations implement practices based on published research, will they produce results consistent with those reported in the articles? To answer this question, it is critical that published articles be transparent in terms of what has been done, why, and how. We investigated 52 articles published in Strategic Management Journal that reported interviewing elite informants (e.g., members of the top management team) and found that none of the articles were sufficiently transparent. These results lead to thorny questions about the trustworthiness of published research, but also important opportunities for future improvements about research transparency and replicability. We offer recommendations on 12 transparency criteria, and how to measure them, that can be used to evaluate past as well as future research using qualitative methods.",

The Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy are similar in design; however, the Falcon Heavy was the first rocket launch system to successfully utilize a reusable first-stage booster system. The methodology employed was an attributional hybrid-Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Upstream and downstream inputs and impacts were accounted for via economic input-output and process-based methodologies. A cradle-to-use-scoped system boundary for the two SpaceX Falcon systems were evaluated on a per-kilogram-delivered-to-geosynchronous-orbit basis. Producer cost data was integrated into the LCA framework to provide a cursory Life Cycle Costing (LCC) producer cost impact category to compare with the LCA environmental impact potentials. Findings showed the combined economic and environmental benefits achieved by SpaceX through developing the Falcon Heavy reusable booster system significantly reduced all evaluated environmental and cost impacts when compared to the Falcon 9. By applying the simple principal of reuse, SpaceX was able to reduce the cost of launch to high orbit by over 6,000 per kilogram while reducing environmental impact potential averages by >40% below the Falcon 9 system. This case study demonstrates the benefit of quantitative sustainability tools to guide economically and environmentally beneficial design for space activities.",

    "abstract": "Global energy transitions could fundamentally change flows of both minerals and energy resources over time. It is, therefore, increasingly important to holistically and dynamically capture the impacts of large-scale energy transitions on resource flows including hidden flows such as mine waste, as well as direct flows. Here we demonstrate a systematic model that can quantify resource flows of both minerals and energy resources under the energy transition by using stock-flow dynamics and the concept of Total Material Requirement (TMR). The proposed model was applied to the International Energy Agency's scenarios up to 2050, targeting 15 electricity generation and 5 transport technologies. Results indicate that the global energy transition could increase TMR flows associated with mineral production by around 200–900% in the electricity sector and 350–700% in the transport sector respectively from 2015 to 2050, depending on the scenarios. Such a drastic increase in TMR flows is largely associated with an increased demand for copper, silver, nickel, lithium and cobalt, as well as steel. Our results highlight that the decarbonization of the electricity sector can reduce energy resource flows and support the hypothesis that the expansion of low-carbon technologies could reduce total resource flows expressed as TMR. In the transport sector, on the other hand, the dissemination of Electric Vehicles could cause a sharp increase in TMR flows associated with mineral production, which could offset a decrease in energy resource flows. Findings in this study emphasize that a sustainable transition would be unachievable without designing resource cycles with a nexus approach.",

    "abstract": "The space sector is a new area of development for Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies. However, it deals with strong particularities which complicate the use of LCA. One of the most important is that the space industry is the only human activity crossing all stages of the atmosphere during the launch event or the atmospheric re-entry. As a result, interactions occur not only with the natural environment but also with the orbital environment during the use phase and the end-of-life of space missions. In this context, there is a lack of indicators and methods to characterise the complete life-cycle of space systems including their impact on the orbital environment. The end-of-life of spacecraft is of particular concern: space debris proliferation is today a concrete threat for all space activities. Therefore, the proposed work aims at characterising the orbital environment in term of space debris crossing the orbital resource. A complete methodology and a set of characterisation factors at midpoint level are provided. They are based on two factors: (i) the exposure to space debris in a given orbit and (ii) the severity of a potential spacecraft break-up leading to the release of new debris in the orbital environment. Then, we demonstrate the feasibility of such approach through three theoretical post-mission disposal scenarios based on the Sentinel-1A mission parameters. The results are discussed against the propellant consumption needed in each case with the purpose of addressing potential ‘burden shifting’ that could occur between the Earth environment and the orbital one.",

Supply constraints shift from fossil fuels to mineral resources. We assess the availability of metal reserves and resources to build an energy system based exclusively on renewable energy technologies. A mass balance of 29 metals embodied in renewable energy technologies is compiled in order to satisfy global energy demand, based on five authoritative energy scenarios for 2050. We expand upon these scenarios by modeling the storage capacity needed to support high shares of intermittent renewables (wind and solar). The metal requirements are then compared with the current demand and proven reserves and ultimate mineable resources. This allows us to distinguish between constraints related to renewable energy sources from those linked to technology mixes. The results show that proven reserves and, in specific cases, resources of several metals are insufficient to build a renewable energy system at the predicted level of global energy demand by 2050. The comparison between reserves and resources shows that scarcity relates sometimes more to techno economic supply than to raw material availability. Our results also highlight the importance of substitution among technologies and metals as well as the limited impact of recycling on the depletion of scarce metals.",

    "abstract": "This research explores the use of sustainability tools for space activities through a case study comparing the cost and environmental impacts of the SpaceX Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy systems. The Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy are similar in design; however, the Falcon Heavy was the first rocket launch system to successfully utilize a reusable first-stage booster system. The methodology employed was an attributional hybrid-Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Upstream and downstream inputs and impacts were accounted for via economic input-output and process-based methodologies. A cradle-to-use-scoped system boundary for the two SpaceX Falcon systems were evaluated on a per-kilogram-delivered-to-geosynchronous-orbit basis. Producer cost data was integrated into the LCA framework to provide a cursory Life Cycle Costing (LCC) producer cost impact category to compare with the LCA environmental impact potentials. Findings showed the combined economic and environmental benefits achieved by SpaceX through developing the Falcon Heavy reusable booster system significantly reduced all evaluated environmental and cost impacts when compared to the Falcon 9. By applying the simple principal of reuse, SpaceX was able to reduce the cost of launch to high orbit by over 6,000 per kilogram while reducing environmental impact potential averages by >40% below the Falcon 9 system. This case study demonstrates the benefit of quantitative sustainability tools to guide economically and environmentally beneficial design for space activities.",

Consistent with the strong growth in renewable energy and electrification of the transport system required in a 1.5°C scenario, the material requirements also rise dramatically, particularly for cobalt and lithium. Scenarios developed for this study show that increasing recycling rates and material efficiency can significantly reduce primary demand for metals.",

    "abstract": "Global energy transitions could fundamentally change flows of both minerals and energy resources over time. It is, therefore, increasingly important to holistically and dynamically capture the impacts of large-scale energy transitions on resource flows including hidden flows such as mine waste, as well as direct flows. Here we demonstrate a systematic model that can quantify resource flows of both minerals and energy resources under the energy transition by using stock-flow dynamics and the concept of Total Material Requirement (TMR). The proposed model was applied to the International Energy Agency's scenarios up to 2050, targeting 15 electricity generation and 5 transport technologies. Results indicate that the global energy transition could increase TMR flows associated with mineral production by around 200–900% in the electricity sector and 350–700% in the transport sector respectively from 2015 to 2050, depending on the scenarios. Such a drastic increase in TMR flows is largely associated with an increased demand for copper, silver, nickel, lithium and cobalt, as well as steel. Our results highlight that the decarbonization of the electricity sector can reduce energy resource flows and support the hypothesis that the expansion of low-carbon technologies could reduce total resource flows expressed as TMR. In the transport sector, on the other hand, the dissemination of Electric Vehicles could cause a sharp increase in TMR flows associated with mineral production, which could offset a decrease in energy resource flows. Findings in this study emphasize that a sustainable transition would be unachievable without designing resource cycles with a nexus approach.",

    "abstract": "The space sector is a new area of development for Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies. However, it deals with strong particularities which complicate the use of LCA. One of the most important is that the space industry is the only human activity crossing all stages of the atmosphere during the launch event or the atmospheric re-entry. As a result, interactions occur not only with the natural environment but also with the orbital environment during the use phase and the end-of-life of space missions. In this context, there is a lack of indicators and methods to characterise the complete life-cycle of space systems including their impact on the orbital environment. The end-of-life of spacecraft is of particular concern: space debris proliferation is today a concrete threat for all space activities. Therefore, the proposed work aims at characterising the orbital environment in term of space debris crossing the orbital resource. A complete methodology and a set of characterisation factors at midpoint level are provided. They are based on two factors: (i) the exposure to space debris in a given orbit and (ii) the severity of a potential spacecraft break-up leading to the release of new debris in the orbital environment. Then, we demonstrate the feasibility of such approach through three theoretical post-mission disposal scenarios based on the Sentinel-1A mission parameters. The results are discussed against the propellant consumption needed in each case with the purpose of addressing potential ‘burden shifting’ that could occur between the Earth environment and the orbital one.",

Nevertheless, there is still an important gap between the behavior and beliefs of society and markets about sustainability, and companies' capability to understand and face this trend. Digital marketing is key to filling this gap. However, research in digital marketing and sustainability is very scarce. The purpose of this research is to examine the literature in the subject, since 2009 until 2018, and to elaborate a research agenda about digital marketing and sustainability. Through a previous analysis based on bibliometrics, a research agenda has been developed that shows the main challenges for the digital marketing and sustainability field: (1) customer orientation and value proposition; (2) digital consumer's behavior; (3) digital green marketing; (4) competitive advantage; (5) supply chain; and (6) capabilities. This work contributes to the development of the research in digital marketing and sustainability, suggesting various challenges for the field that lead to future lines of research, and favoring the development of a new research approach capable of reducing the existing gap between society and business on sustainability issues.",

    "abstract": "The Earth's orbital space environment constitutes a finite resource that is being used by an increasing number of States, international intergovernmental organizations and non-governmental entities. The proliferation of space debris, the increasing complexity of space operations, the emergence of large constellations and the increased risks of collision and interference with the operation of space objects are raising concerns about the long-term sustainability of outer space activities. Addressing these developments and risks requires international cooperation. In 2010, the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UN COPUOS) established a working group to address these matters and to propose a set of voluntary, non-binding guidelines for States that represent a compendium of internationally recognized measures for, and commitments to, ensuring the long-term sustainability of outer space activities and, in particular, enhancing the safety of space operations. This paper describes the efforts of this Working Group in the context of other multilateral space security initiatives. The first twelve guidelines, which were agreed in 2016, are briefly discussed, as well as the linkages of this process with the recommendations contained in the report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Transparency and Confidence-Building Measures in Outer Space Activities. The paper ends with some reflections on factors shaping the negotiations of the remaining draft guidelines as the Working Group enters its final round of negotiations in 2018.",

    "abstract": "Fragmentation events, caused by the collision of two objects in space, have been a significant source of space debris objects over a cumulative five decades of space activity. Current proposals by different commercial entities aim to launch constellations comprising thousands of satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), which would result in an increase of more than five times the number of currently active satellites in a region where debris objects are most concentrated. The Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC) has already recognized the potential influence of large constellations on the LEO environment and the subsequent need to assess whether current mitigation guidelines will be adequate moving forward. Given developments for such constellations are already underway, independent research efforts ahead of any revision to current IADC guidelines could be of great value not only to the organizations involved in their operation, but also to policymakers and existing space users. This paper evaluates the probability of collisions for mega-constellations operating in the current LEO debris environment under best and worst-case implementation of current mitigation guidelines. Simulation studies are performed using the European Space Agency's (ESA) MASTER-2009 debris evolutionary model, and the specifications of the proposed OneWeb and SpaceX constellations as example mega-constellations. Multiple scenarios are then tested to assess mitigation measures and their ability to minimize the probability of fragmentation events and the creation of new debris in LEO.",

Yet, light pollution has not achieved parity with other global change phenomena in the level of concern and interest it receives from the scientific community, government and nongovernmental organizations. This is despite the globally widespread, expanding and changing nature of night-time lighting and the immediacy, severity and phylogenetic breath of its impacts. In this opinion piece, we evidence 10 reasons why artificial light at night should be a focus for global change research in the 21st century. Our reasons extend beyond those concerned principally with the environment, to also include impacts on human health, culture and biodiversity conservation more generally. We conclude that the growing use of night-time lighting will continue to raise numerous ecological, human health and cultural issues, but that opportunities exist to mitigate its impacts by combining novel technologies with sound scientific evidence. The potential gains from appropriate management extend far beyond those for the environment, indeed it may play a key role in transitioning towards a more sustainable society.",

All LV were launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in 2014–2016. The operation of the LV leads to local mechanical, chemical, and pyrogenic effects on the ecosystems of separating stages falling regions (FR). Mechanical disturbances of ecosystems on the Proton first stage falling sites (FS) took the form of soil and vegetation cover damage when the large fragments scattered over an area of 1229 m2 and small fragments scattered over an area of 22,044 m2. The area of vegetation fire reached 245,588 m2, and the leakage of propellant components (nitrogen tetroxide (NT) and unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH)) – up to 737 m2. We detected UDMH mainly in the snow of the Proton first stage FS, where its content reached up to 2200 mg/dm3 (the most common range of concentrations was 0.1–0.2 mg/dm3) and in sporadic soil samples it was up to 1.5 mg/kg. In early spring the content of UDMH was 0.09–0.69 mg/kg in the soil, in summer it did not exceed 0.05 mg/kg. In the NT leakage areas content of NO3– increased up to 22.3 g/dm3 in the snow and 24.8 g/kg in the soil. In the places of UDMH leakages, pH value in the snow and soil increased to 10.3 and 9.4, respectively, and the background values varied from 5.1 to 7.9 and from 6.6 to 8.3, respectively. The pollution of snow and soil by NT decreased in pH value to 0.9, and 2.3, respectively. In the cases of Soyuz side blocks, the scattering of FS of large and small fragments reached 325 and 43,627 m2, respectively, the area of vegetation fire – up to 8556 m2, and the leakage of propellant components – to 129 m2. The contents of total petroleum hydrocarbons in places of kerosene T-1 leakage increased to 4354 mg/dm3 in the snow and to 45,167 mg/kg in the soil while background values were 0.03–0.05 mg/dm3 and 5–84 mg/kg, respectively. The operation of the heavy vehicle during the evacuation of fragments of the LV first stage can expand the impact zone several times. In the FR of the Proton and Soyuz second stages the main impact is associated with the mechanical pollution of ecosystems with the fragments of fallen stages.

    "abstract": "The environmental impacts of artificial light at night have been a rapidly growing field of global change science in recent years. Yet, light pollution has not achieved parity with other global change phenomena in the level of concern and interest it receives from the scientific community, government and nongovernmental organizations. This is despite the globally widespread, expanding and changing nature of night-time lighting and the immediacy, severity and phylogenetic breath of its impacts. In this opinion piece, we evidence 10 reasons why artificial light at night should be a focus for global change research in the 21st century. Our reasons extend beyond those concerned principally with the environment, to also include impacts on human health, culture and biodiversity conservation more generally. We conclude that the growing use of night-time lighting will continue to raise numerous ecological, human health and cultural issues, but that opportunities exist to mitigate its impacts by combining novel technologies with sound scientific evidence. The potential gains from appropriate management extend far beyond those for the environment, indeed it may play a key role in transitioning towards a more sustainable society.",

    "abstract": "A rising sustainability concern is occurring in the space sector: 29,000 human-made objects, larger than 10 cm are orbiting the Earth but only 6% are operational spacecrafts. Today, space debris is today a significant and constant danger to all space missions. Consequently, it becomes compelled to design new space missions considering End-of-Life requirements in order to ensure the sustainable use of space orbits. Furthermore, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has been identified by the European Space Agency as an adequate tool to measure the environmental impact of spacecraft missions. Hence, our challenge is to integrate orbital space use into Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) to broaden the scope of LCA for space systems. The generation of debris in the near-Earth's orbital regions leads to a decrease in volume availability. The Area-of-Protection (AoP) ‘resources’ seems to be the most relevant reflection of this depletion. To address orbital space use in a comprehensive way, we propose a first attempt at establishing an impact pathway linking outer space use to resources. This framework will be the basis for defining new indicator(s) related to orbital space use.",

    "abstract": "Recently, several announcements have been published to deploy satellite constellations into Low Earth Orbit (LEO) containing several hundred to thousands of rather small sized objects. The purpose of these constellations is to provide a worldwide internet coverage, even to the remotest areas. Examples of these mega-constellations are one from SpaceX, which is announced to comprise of about 4000 satellites, the Norwegian STEAM network, which is told to contain 4257 satellites, and the OneWeb constellation, which forms one of the smaller constellations with 720 satellites. As example constellation, OneWeb has been chosen. From all announced constellation, OneWeb by far delivered most information, both in regards to constellation design and their plans to encounter space debris issues, which is the reason why it has been chosen for these analyses. In this paper, at first an overview of the planned OneWeb constellation setup is given. From this description, a mission life-cycle is deduced, splitting the complete orbital lifetime of the satellites into four phases. Following, using ESA-MASTER, for each of the mission phases the flux on both single constellations satellites and the complete constellation are performed and the collision probabilities are derived. The focus in this analysis is set on catastrophic collisions. This analysis is then varied parametrically for different operational altitudes of the constellation as well as different lifetimes with different assumptions for the success of post mission disposal (PMD). Following the to-be-expected mean number of collision avoidance manoeuvres during all active mission phases is performed using ARES from ESA's DRAMA tool suite. The same variations as during the flux analysis are considered. Lastly the characteristics of hypothetical OneWeb satellite fragmentation clouds, calculated using the NASA Breakup model, are described and the impact of collision clouds from OneWeb satellites on the constellation itself is analysed.",

    "abstract": "Several numerical approaches exist to simulate the evolution of the space debris environment. These simulations usually rely on the propagation of a large population of objects in order to determine the collision probability for each object. Explosion and collision events are triggered randomly using a Monte-Carlo (MC) approach. So in many different scenarios different objects are fragmented and contribute to a different version of the space debris environment. The results of the single Monte-Carlo runs therefore represent the whole spectrum of possible evolutions of the space debris environment. For the comparison of different scenarios, in general the average of all MC runs together with its standard deviation is used. This method is computationally very expensive due to the propagation of thousands of objects over long timeframes and the application of the MC method. At the Institute of Space Systems (IRAS) a model capable of describing the evolution of the space debris environment has been developed and implemented. The model is based on source and sink mechanisms, where yearly launches as well as collisions and explosions are considered as sources. The natural decay and post mission disposal measures are the only sink mechanisms. This method reduces the computational costs tremendously. In order to achieve this benefit a few simplifications have been applied. The approach of the model partitions the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) region into altitude shells. Only two kinds of objects are considered, intact bodies and fragments, which are also divided into diameter bins. As an extension to a previously presented model the eccentricity has additionally been taken into account with 67 eccentricity bins. While a set of differential equations has been implemented in a generic manner, the Euler method was chosen to integrate the equations for a given time span. For this paper parameters have been derived so that the model is able to reflect the results of the numerical MC-based simulation Long-term Utility for Collision Analysis (LUCA), which is also being developed at the IRAS. The evolution of the population in LEO for a 200 years time span is shown and compared for both approaches using step sizes of 1 year. For selected objects in LEO the collision flux values are shown. Additionally a value called environmental criticality (EC) is derived. It describes the effect an object can have on the space debris environment. In conclusion the field of application for such a fast model is shown.",

Meeting the TR in relation to anthropogenic impact decrease based on the conventional design approach and the content of the onboard system does not prove to be efficient and leads to depreciation of the initial technical characteristics obtained at the first design stage if these requirements are not included. In this concern, it is shown that the implementation of additional active onboard de-orbiting system (AODS) of worked-off stages (WS) into the onboard LV stages systems allows to meet the TR related to the LV environmental characteristics, including fire-explosion safety.

    "abstract": "This paper describes a method based on virtual reality tools to achieve the attitude determination of an orbiting object using lightcurve measurements. A virtual model of the orbiting object is propagated in order to reproduce its lightcurve. The differences between the real and simulated lightcurves are used as the cost function to be minimized through a multiobjective genetic algorithm. Lightcurve measurements in different spectral bands, both with monostatic and multistatic optical observations can be used. The method is applied to the real measurements taken from Cerro Tololo and Flagstaff Observatory of the spacecraft GSAT3. A set of attitude parameters compatible with the measured lightcurves is identified and discussed.",

    "abstract": "© 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers. A recently emerged driving requirement for microsatellites is a precise and fast attitude maneuvering capability. Agility enhances the operational efficiency of missions requiring a high level of retargeting ability, such as space station and satellite on-orbit servicing, formation flying, Earth monitoring, and space-based space debris observation and tracking. Three-axis stabilized microsatellites are mainly equipped with momentum wheels, barely meeting agility requirements. In this paper, the design and manufacturing of a cluster of four single-gimbal variable-speed control-moment gyros (SGCMGs), suitable for attitude control with high-agility capability of a 10-30 kg class microsatellite, is presented. The flywheel design is based on a brushless motor out-runner configuration, in which the motor magnets, embedded in the rotor, provide for the wheel inertia. This configuration has the advantage of providing a high inertia while minimizing cogging torque at low speed. The elimination of the wheel dummy mass provides a significant improvement in the system mass efficiency. In addition, this configuration allows using commercial off-the-shelf parts, eliminating the wheel-balancing procedure with evident jitter limitation and economic and development time benefits. A relevant feature is the electronics architecture based on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) integrated circuit, chosen to improve power efficiency and provide a high level of reliability for the system. This can be assured by proper time and space redundancy for each low-level logic block of the design. The system performance in terms of provided torque and power consumption has been experimentally measured by using a ground-testing prototype mounted on a test bed, and the results are reported. The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed actuator as an efficient solution for the attitude control of microsatellites, in terms of mass, volume, and power constraints.",

    "abstract": "Background: Shared facilities are not recognised as improved sanitation due to challenges of maintenance as they easily can be avenues for the spread of diseases. Thus there is need to evaluate the quality of shared facilities, especially in informal settlements, where they are commonly used. A shared facility can be equated to a common good whose management depends on the users. If users do not work collectively towards keeping the facility clean, it is likely that the quality may depreciate due to lack of maintenance. This study examined the quality of shared sanitation facilities and used the common pool resource (CPR) management principles to examine the determinants of shared sanitation quality in the informal settlements of Kisumu, Kenya. Methods: Using a multiple case study design, the study employed both quantitative and qualitative methods. In both phases, users of shared sanitation facilities were interviewed, while shared sanitation facilities were inspected. Shared sanitation quality was a score which was the dependent variable in a regression analysis. Interviews during the qualitative stage were aimed at understanding management practices of shared sanitation users. Qualitative data was analysed thematically by following the CPR principles. Results: Shared facilities, most of which were dirty, were shared by an average of eight households, and their quality decreased with an increase in the number of households sharing. The effect of numbers on quality is explained by behaviour reflected in the CPR principles, as it was easier to define boundaries of shared facilities when there were fewer users who cooperated towards improving their shared sanitation facility. Other factors, such as defined management systems, cooperation, collective decision making, and social norms, also played a role in influencing the behaviour of users towards keeping shared facilities clean and functional. Conclusion: Apart from hardware factors, quality of shared sanitation is largely due to group behaviour of users. The CPR principles form a crucial lens through which the dynamics of shared sanitation facilities in informal settlements can be understood. Development and policy efforts should incorporate group behaviour as they determine the quality of shared sanitation facilities.",

    "abstract": "Recent technology advances have made CubeSats not only an affordable means of access to space, but also promising platforms to develop a new variety of space applications. In this paper, we explore the idea of using nanosatellites as access points to provide extended coverage to the Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications. This study is mainly motivated by two facts: on the one hand, it is already obvious that the number of machine-type devices deployed globally will experiment an exponential growth over the forthcoming years. This trend is pushed by the available terrestrial cellular infrastructure, which allows adding support for M2M connectivity at marginal costs. On the other hand, the same growth is not observed in remote areas that must rely on space-based connectivity. In such environments, the demand for M2M communications is potentially large, yet it is challenged by the lack of cost-effective service providers. The traffic characteristics of typical M2M applications translate into the requirement for an extremely low cost per transmitted message. Under these strong economical constraints, we expect that nanosatellites in the low Earth orbit will play a fundamental role in overcoming what we may call the IoT digital divide. The objective of this paper is therefore to provide a general analysis of a nanosatellite-based, global IoT/M2M network. We put emphasis in the engineering challenges faced in designing the Earth-to-Space communication link, where the adoption of an efficient multiple-access scheme is paramount for ensuring connectivity to a large number of terminal nodes. In particular, the trade-offs energy efficiency–access delay and energy efficiency–throughput are discussed, and a novel access approach suitable for delay-tolerant applications is proposed. Thus, by keeping a system-level standpoint, we identify key issues and discuss perspectives towards energy efficient and cost-effective solutions.",

This paper also highlights how the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) would contribute to ensure the actual use of EO in support of the 2030 Agenda; and how the Global Earth Observations System of Systems meets requirements for efficient investments in science and technology and a good return on investment, which is elaborated in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on development financing. Through a number of examples, we first discuss how extensive EO use would: provide a substantial contribution to the achievements of the SDGs by enabling informed decision-making and by allowing monitoring of the expected results; improve national statistics for greater accuracy, by ensuring that the data are “spatially-explicit” and directly contribute to calculate the agreed SDG Targets and Indicators support the fostering of synergy between the SDGs and multilateral environmental agreements by addressing cross-cutting themes such as climate and energy; and facilitate countries’ approaches for working across different development sectors, which is, according to the special adviser on the 2030 Agenda, a key challenge to achieve the SDGs. We then focus on the role that GEO could play in enabling actual use of EO in support of the 2030 Agenda by directly addressing the Strategic Development Goal 17 on partnerships.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the Mars One program has gained significant publicity for its plans to colonize the red planet. Beginning in 2025, the program plans to land four people on Mars every 26 months via a series of one-way missions, using exclusively existing technology. This one-way approach has frequently been cited as a key enabler of accelerating the first crewed landing on Mars. While the Mars One program has received considerable attention, little has been published in the technical literature regarding the formulation of its mission architecture. In light of this, we perform an independent analysis of the technical feasibility of the Mars One mission plan, focusing on the architecture of the life support and in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) systems, and their impact on sparing and space logistics. To perform this analysis, we adopt an iterative analysis approach in which we model and simulate the mission architecture, assess its feasibility, implement any applicable modifications while attempting to remain within the constraints set forth by Mars One, and then resimulate and reanalyze the revised version of the mission architecture. Where required information regarding the Mars One mission architecture is not available, we assume numerical values derived from standard spaceflight design handbooks and documents. Through four iterations of this process, our analysis finds that the Mars One mission plan, as publicly described, is not feasible. This conclusion is obtained from analyses based on mission assumptions derived from and constrained by statements made by Mars One, and is the result of the following findings: (1) several technologies including ISRU, life support, and entry, descent, and landing (EDL) are not currently \"existing, validated and available\" as claimed by Mars One; (2) the crop growth area described by Mars One is insufficient to feed their crew; (3) increasing the crop growth area to provide sufficient food for the crew leads to atmospheric imbalances that requires a prohibitively large ISRU atmospheric processor or a notably different system architecture to manage; and (4) at least 13 Falcon Heavy launches are needed to deliver a portion of the required equipment to the Martian surface, a value that is at least double that planned by Mars One for the same mission phase. Most importantly, we find that the one-way nature of the Mars One mission, coupled with its plans to increase its crew population every 26 months, causes the operating costs of the program to grow continually over time. This is due to the fact that maintaining a growing colony on the Martian surface incurs increasing equipment and spare parts resupply requirements and hence launch costs over time. Based on published launch vehicle and lander estimates, our analysis finds that by the launch of the fifth crew, the cost associated with launching a portion of all required equipment and spares is approximately equal to half of the total NASA FY2015 budget - and this cost will grow when other critical systems outside the scope of this analysis are included. To mitigate these costs and bring the plan closer towards feasibility, we recommend a number of mission architecture modifications and technology development efforts be implemented before the initiation of any Mars settlement campaign. These include the further development of EDL, life support, and ISRU technologies, as well as additive manufacturing technology that utilizes ISRU-derived Martian feedstock as a potential means to address the growing cost of resupply.",

In this study, two typical configurations, the RAM-C II vehicle and FIRE II capsule, are selected as test cases, whose thermo-chemical nonequilibrium flowfields are computed by a multi-block finite volume code using a two-temperature model (a translational-rotational temperature and a vibrational-electron-electronic temperature). In the RAM-C II case, it is indicated that although electron number density distributions of the two reaction models appear in a similar trend, their values are distinctively different. Results of the Gupta's model show a better agreement with the electrostatic probe data, while those of the Park's model are more consistent with the reflectometers data. Both models give similar temperature distributions. In the FIRE II case, the two models yield significantly different distribution profiles of ions and electrons, whose differences could reach an order of magnitude. In addition, an abnormal nonequilibrium relaxation process in the shock layer is found in the FIRE II flowfield simulated by the Gupta's model, which proves to be a consequence of electron impact ionization reactions.",

    "abstract": "Water quality monitoring during human spaceflights is essential. However, most of the traditional methods require sample collection with a subsequent ground analysis because of the limitations in volume, power, safety and gravity. The space missions are becoming longer-lasting; hence methods suitable for in-flight monitoring are demanded. Since 2009, water quality has been monitored in-flight with colorimetric methods allowing for detection of iodine and ionic silver. Organic compounds in water have been monitored with a second generation total organic carbon analyzer, which provides information on the amount of carbon in water at both the U.S. and Russian segments of the International Space Station since 2008. The disadvantage of this approach is the lack of compound-specific information. The recently developed methods and tools may potentially allow one to obtain in-flight a more detailed information on water quality. Namely, the microanalyzers based on potentiometric measurements were designed for online detection of chloride, potassium, nitrate ions and ammonia. The recent application of the current highly developed air quality monitoring system for water analysis was a logical step because most of the target analytes are the same in air and water. An electro-thermal vaporizer was designed, manufactured and coupled with the air quality control system. This development allowed for liberating the analytes from the aqueous matrix and further compound-specific analysis in the gas phase.",

    "abstract": "In order to explore the impact of gas temperature on the nozzle damping characteristics of solid rocket motor, numerical simulations were carried out by an experimental motor in Naval Ordnance Test Station of China Lake in California. Using the pulse decay method, different cases were numerically studied via Fluent along with UDF (User Defined Functions). Firstly, mesh sensitivity analysis and monitor position-independent analysis were carried out for the computer code validation. Then, the numerical method was further validated by comparing the calculated results and experimental data. Finally, the effects of gas temperature on the nozzle damping characteristics were studied in this paper. The results indicated that the gas temperature had cooperative effects on the nozzle damping and there had great differences between cold flow and hot fire test. By discussion and analysis, it was found that the changing of mainstream velocity and the natural acoustic frequency resulted from gas temperature were the key factors that affected the nozzle damping, while the alteration of the mean pressure had little effect. Thus, the high pressure condition could be replaced by low pressure to reduce the difficulty of the test. Finally, the relation of the coefficients \"alpha\" between the cold flow and hot fire was got.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of ranking the upper stages in orbit in order to evaluate their potential detrimental effects on the debris environment over the long-term, and the relative advantage of having them actively de-orbited. To do so, a new ranking scheme is introduced, applicable to any object in low Earth orbit (LEO) and able to prioritize the target objects potentially most critical for the future preservation of the LEO protected region. Applying the proposed approach, it was found, for instance, that the 22 most massive upper stages abandoned in LEO, at the beginning of 2015, are on the whole equivalent to several hundred average intact objects in sun-synchronous orbit, regarding their latent detrimental effects on the debris environment over the next 200 years. Most of them could therefore be the top priority targets of any worldwide coordinated effort for active removal and the prevention of new collisional debris. The ranking scheme was also applied to other main models of rocket bodies currently in orbit, trying to identify the combinations of orbital elements and upper stage types requiring particular attention.",

    "abstract": "Over the last 60 years, Space Debris has become one of the main challenges for the safe operation of satellites in low Earth orbit. To address this threat, guidelines that include a limited debris release during normal operations, minimization of the potential for on-orbit break-ups and post mission disposal have begun to be implemented. However, for the long-term, the amount of debris will still increase due to fragments created by collisions of objects in space. The active removal of space debris of at least five large objects per years is therefore recommended, but not yet included in those guidelines. Even though various technical concepts have been developed over the last years, the question on how to make them reliable and safe or how to finance such mission has not been answered. This paper addresses the first two topics. With Space Debris representing an uncooperative and possibly tumbling target, close proximity becomes absolutely critical, especially when an uninterrupted connection to the ground station is not ensured. This paper therefore defines firstly a mission to remove at least five large objects and secondly introduces a preliminary autonomy concept fitted for this mission.",

Building on prior research that examined the development paths of space actors in three emerging space regions of the world and their impact on space sustainability, this paper will offer insights on the current space sustainability concerns and priorities of Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico. Through literature review, personal communication with experts, and by examining the involvement of these actors in international space forums, this paper identifies common themes about how these actors approach the concept of sustainability, their primary concerns, and involvement in and perspectives on mechanisms to promote it.

We draw on the example of a project that analyzes indicators of innovation activities and strategies in 300 U.S. small- and medium-sized enterprises in green goods industries. We present six steps to access historical Wayback website data: (a) sampling, (b) organizing and defining the boundaries of the web crawl, (c) crawling, (d) website variable operationalization, (e) integration with other data sources, and (f) analysis. Although our examples draw on specific types of firms in green goods industries, the method can be generalized to other areas of research.

    "abstract": "The paper reviews the evolution of Earth Observation systems in Europe and Worldwide and analyses the potential impact of their performance in support of emergency response services. Earth Observation satellites play already a significant role in supporting the action of first responders in case of major disasters. The main principle is the coordinated use of satellites in order to ensure a rapid response and the timely delivery of images and geospatial information of the area affected by the event. The first part of the paper reviews the main instruments and evaluates their current performance. The International Charter “Space and Major Disasters”, signed in October 2000, was the first international initiative aimed at establishing a unified system for the acquisition of space data. The charter is a cooperation agreement between space agencies and operators of space systems. At regional level, a similar instrument exists in Asia: Sentinel-Asia. In the frame of the European programme Copernicus, the emergency management service was launched in 2009. Geo-information products derived from space imagery are delivered during all phases of the emergency management cycle, in either rush or non-rush mode, free of charge for the users. In both cases, the capacities were historically drawn from national missions, funded with public money and directly operated by the space agencies or by national operators. The paper focuses on the performance of the space infrastructure (satellites and ground segments). Several trends may have a significant impact on the current performance: – The increasing number of space systems which are privately-owned and managed by commercial operators. – The emergence in Europe of shared-ownership or community-owned systems. Copernicus Sentinel missions (Copernicus) or Eumetsat satellites are two typical examples. – The development of dual-use capacities and the sovereignty dimension of these systems. – The development of unmanned airborne vehicles (UAVs) for civil applications. – The development of social media and crowd-based initiatives for humanitarian aid and emergency response. – Possible disruptions, such as large LEO constellations or GEO infrastructures enabling persistent observation.A common feature is the increased number of information sources and the higher real time dimension. Typical scenarios for the future are described and their likelihood is discussed, including political acceptance and the international dimension. Aside from rapid technological evolutions, two main driving factors are the capacity of national and international stakeholders to agree on governance and the sustainability of the economic models.",

The rapid spread of outdoor electric lighting across the globe over the past century has caused an unprecedented disruption to these natural light cycles. Artificial light is widespread in the environment, varying in intensity by several orders of magnitude from faint skyglow reflected from distant cities to direct illumination of urban and suburban vegetation.

In response, space agencies have identified a set of mitigation guidelines aimed at enabling space users to reduce the generation of space debris by, for example, limiting the orbital lifetime of their spacecraft and launcher stages after the end of their mission. Planned, large constellations of satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO), though addressing the lack of basic internet coverage in some world regions, may disrupt the sustainability of the space environment enabled by these mitigation practices. We analyse the response of the space object population to the introduction of a large constellation conforming to the post-mission disposal guideline with differing levels of success and with different disposal orbit options. The results show that a high success rate of post-mission disposal by constellation satellites is a key driver for space sustainability.",

    ],
    "abstract": "The number of artificial objects in orbit continues to increase and, with it, a key threat to space sustainability. In response, space agencies have identified a set of mitigation guidelines aimed at enabling space users to reduce the generation of space debris by, for example, limiting the orbital lifetime of their spacecraft and launcher stages after the end of their mission. Planned, large constellations of satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO), though addressing the lack of basic internet coverage in some world regions, may disrupt the sustainability of the space environment enabled by these mitigation practices. We analyse the response of the space object population to the introduction of a large constellation conforming to the post-mission disposal guideline with differing levels of success and with different disposal orbit options. The results show that a high success rate of post-mission disposal by constellation satellites is a key driver for space sustainability.",

In this article, he comments on the framework's popular useage and then presents a summary of the four-part definitional framework upon which the pyramid was created. He then comments on several characteristics of the model that were not emphasized when initially published: ethics permeates the pyramid; tensions and tradeoffs inherent; its' integrated, unified whole; its' sustainable stakeholder framework, and; its' global applicability and use in different contexts. The article concludes by looking to the future.",

The selection of the observer satellite's has been done in order to maximize the number of observed objects in LEO, based on a statistical analysis of the space debris population in this region. The space objects' observability condition is analyzed and two batch estimator based on the Levenberg-Marquardt and on the Powell dog-leg algorithms have been implemented and their performance compared. Both the algorithms are sensitive to the initial guess. Its influence on the algorithms' convergence is assessed, showing that the Powell dog-leg, which is a trust region method, performs better.",

However, state sovereignty remains, and shall remain, central to the law, politics, and economics of space. States will continue to be important space actors, and even as private space actors emerge, governments shall play a vital enabling and regulatory functions. The exact role states will play in future economic development of space, as well as the nature of the relationship between state and non-state actors in space, depends on the concept of state sovereignty. This article discusses theoretical understandings of state sovereignty, outlines the current legal regime for space, examines controversies in space law, and explores possible scenarios for future forms of state sovereignty or jurisdiction in space. It concludes that the best outcome is where international law evolves in anticipation of these new developments to ensure a stable international regime for space.",

    "abstract": "Given the renewed interest in exploring and exploiting the resources of the Moon, this paper will explore the proposition that sustainability should be a fundamental consideration when formulating policy in respect of regulating lunar activities. The current lunar regulatory framework, however, is a product of the Cold War and conceived at a time when sustainability and space environmental issues were not within the contemplation of policy makers. Yet there is an increasing awareness of the need for space sustainability within the space community and this should be focused towards shaping policy in respect of lunar exploration. Inherently linked to this is a new multi-sectored era of space activity with emerging space nations and private companies competing alongside established space actors to exploit the natural resources of the Moon. Disputes over legally binding methods of lunar resource allocation are harming the chances of obtaining any consensus regarding sustainable development. This discussion will show that there is no compelling evidence that commercial mining of the Moon will yield the vast natural resources that would make such a venture economically viable. It will be advocated that a policy of promoting the use of the moon for scientific and exploratory purposes by means of existing fora such as IDAC and using non-binding codes to create normative values of sustainability should be placed at the heart of lunar exploration policy.",

Contributing factors that lead to extreme values include high geopolitical concentration of primary production, lack of available suitable substitutes, and political instability. The results show that the limitations for many metals important in emerging electronics (e.g., gallium and selenium) are largely those related to supply risk; those of platinum group metals, gold, and mercury, to environmental implications; and steel alloying elements (e.g., chromium and niobium) as well as elements used in high-temperature alloys (e.g., tungsten and molybdenum), to vulnerability to supply restriction. The metals of most concern tend to be those available largely or entirely as byproducts, used in small quantities for highly specialized applications, and possessing no effective substitutes.",

    "abstract": "The European Union (EU) is influential in environmental politics and policy-making across its 28 member states, around its periphery, and globally. Building on a diverse analytical and empirical literature, this article's seven sections each highlights important research findings and outcomes from more than four decades of EU environmental governance. These include (a) a substantial transfer of legal authority from member states to the supranational level; (b) a growing involvement of EU bodies, advocacy groups, and civil society in regional goal-setting and decision-making; (c) the development of elaborate governance systems and mechanisms for making, implementing, and enforcing policy; (d) EU exercise of considerable influence over countries seeking membership before and after joining the Union; (e) increased EU participation and influence in international fora; (f) a mixed record of uneven implementation and varied environmental outcomes in Europe and across the world; and (g) continuing challenges in nascent attempts to engender greater resource efficiency and sustainability in Europe and beyond. All of these findings and outcomes suggest numerous areas and directions for additional research.",

    "abstract": "Space policy is at the cutting edge of current EU policy developments and is a fascinating object of study, involving multiple and diverse actors. It is also an original and contemporary lens for studying European policy-making. This book explores advances in European space policy and their significance for European integration. Using a 'framing' methodology, it addresses central questions in European studies in order to form an interdisciplinary bridge between current research in space policy and contemporary European political studies. It assesses the interests of EU institutions in space and how these institutions perceive space policy. Furthermore, it demonstrates that space is a cross-cutting policy domain affecting a diverse range of EU policy fields, such as security, transport and migration, and underpinning the 21st century European and global economy. In doing so, this volume firmly locates space policy in the field of European Studies. This innovative volume will be of key interest to students and scholars of a range of policy areas including common foreign and security policy, technology policy, transport policy, internal market policies, environmental policy, development aid and disaster-risk management, as well as the EU institutions.",

    "abstract": "Although existing international instruments such as the Outer Space Treaty and Moon Agreement generally express sentiments for minimizing missions' extraterrestrial environmental impacts, they tend to be limited in scope, vague and generally unenforceable. There is no formal structure for assessing how and to what extent we affect those environments, no opportunity for public participation, no uniform protocol for documenting and registering the effects of our actions and no requirement to mitigate adverse impacts or take them into consideration in the decision-making process. Except for precautions limiting forward biological contamination and issues related to Earth satellites, environmental impact analysis, when done at all, remains focused on how missions affect the Earth and near-Earth environments, not how our actions affect the Moon, Mars, Europa, comets and other potential destinations. Extraterrestrial environmental impacts are potentially counterproductive to future space exploration, exploitation and scientific investigations. Clear, consistent and effective international protocols guiding a process for assessing such impacts are warranted. While instruments such as the US National Environmental Policy Act provide legally tested and efficient regulatory models that can guide impact assessment here on Earth, statutory legal frameworks may not work as well in the international environment of outer space. A proposal for industry-driven standards and an environmental code of conduct based, in part, on best management practices are offered for consideration.",

The enhancements with respect to the use of a single telescope located at mid-latitude, for space debris detection and tracking are highlighted in terms of surveying volume, object identification, and orbital determination accuracy. The need to improve observation capabilities in monitoring and cataloguing such kinds of objects is constantly growing, due to the constant increase of operative satellites and space debris in both geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) and low Earth orbit (LEO) regions. After the considerations on the feasibility of the whole system, an overview of the observatories' design is sketched, on the basis of previous Italian experience in space debris observation, and taking into account constraints imposed by the instrumentation. In particular the main characteristics of components, software for image analysis and observation methodologies are analyzed and a possible configuration is given, based on the ALMASCOPE observatory realized by the Space Robotics Group at the University of Bologna.

    "abstract": "The space debris is a challenging problem for the human activity in the space. Observation campaigns are conducted around the globe to detect and track uncontrolled space objects. One of the main problems in optical observation is obtaining useful information about the debris dynamical state by the images collected. For orbit determination, the most relevant information embedded in optical observation is the precise angular position, which can be evaluated by astrometry procedures, comparing the stars inside the image with star catalogs. This is typically a time consuming process, if done by a human operator, which makes this task impractical when dealing with large amounts of data, in the order of thousands images per night, generated by routinely conducted observations. An automated procedure is investigated in this paper that is capable to recognize the debris track inside a picture, calculate the celestial coordinates of the image's center and use these information to compute the debris angular position in the sky. This procedure has been implemented in a software code, that does not require human interaction and works without any supplemental information besides the image itself, detecting space objects and solving for their angular position without a priori information. The algorithm for object detection was developed inside the research team. For the star field computation, the software code astrometry.net was used and released under GPL v2 license. The complete procedure was validated by an extensive testing, using the images obtained in the observation campaign performed in a joint project between the Italian Space Agency (ASI) and the University of Bologna at the Broglio Space center, Kenya. © 2014 IAA.

    "abstract": "Qualitative and mixed methods play a prominent role in mental health services research. However, the standards for their use are not always evident, especially for those not trained in such methods. This article reviews the rationale and common approaches to using qualitative and mixed methods in mental health services and implementation research based on a review of the articles included in this special series along with representative examples from the literature. Qualitative methods are used to provide a “thick description” or depth of understanding to complement breadth of understanding afforded by quantitative methods, elicit the perspective of those being studied, explore issues that have not been well studied, develop conceptual theories or test hypotheses, or evaluate the process of a phenomenon or intervention. Qualitative methods adhere to many of the same principles of scientific rigor as quantitative methods but often differ with respect to study design, data collection, and data analysis strategies. For instance, participants for qualitative studies are usually sampled purposefully rather than at random and the design usually reflects an iterative process alternating between data collection and analysis. The most common techniques for data collection are individual semistructured interviews, focus groups, document reviews, and participant observation. Strategies for analysis are usually inductive, based on principles of grounded theory or phenomenology. Qualitative methods are also used in combination with quantitative methods in mixed-method designs for convergence, complementarity, expansion, development, and sampling. Rigorously applied qualitative methods offer great potential in contributing to the scientific foundation of mental health services research.",

This study explores the underlying mechanics of the ethical purchase intention-behavior gap in the context of consumers' daily lives. The study employs multiple qualitative methods across multiple sites, explores the intention-behavior gap in observed modes of shopping behavior, and uses an interpretive approach. The analysis reveals four interrelated factors affecting the ethical intention-behavior gap: (1) prioritization of ethical concerns; (2) formation of plans/habits; (3) willingness to commit and sacrifice; and (4) modes of shopping behavior. Awareness of these four factors provides both strategic and tactical implications for marketing managers seeking to reach the elusive ethical consumer. Understanding and enhancing ethical consumption - closing the gap - has positive outcomes for the future sustainability of economies, societies and environments. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",

The most frequent justifications were scientific discoveries, technological development as well as national prestige. The current study aims to have a different look at the question \"Which are the benefits brought by space?\" by investigating/sampling/interrogating the public opinion and identifying the perception and view of the generation that form the bulk of the taxpaying citizens for the immediate future and will be actively financing any future missions. The study focuses on the answers provided to an online survey by an international sample of population. The target individuals are in the age range of 25-44 and are users of social networks. They are either employed or students, but they are not directly involved with the space sector. The survey aims to establish whether the promotional activities of ESA, NASA and other space agencies are aligned with the perceived benefits of this sample population. Is space contributing to what the target people consider important? What could be done to improve/change this perception? How did the public perception evolve? Which are the biggest problems humanity is confronted with today according to the sample population? Could space help addressing these major problems? The paper will firstly present the statistical analysis of the sample answers and the conclusions that can be drawn from them. In a second step it will compare the perceptions and expectations of the public in regards to space with the current space agencies strategies and identify the gaps and discontinuities. © 2013 IAA.",

Although it is known that only a small fraction of atmospheric aerosols are efficient ice nuclei, the critical ingredients that make those aerosols so effective have not been established. We have determined in situ the composition of the residual particles within cirrus crystals after the ice was sublimated. Our results demonstrate that mineral dust and metallic particles are the dominant source of residual particles, whereas sulfate and organic particles are underrepresented, and elemental carbon and biological materials are essentially absent. Further, composition analysis combined with relative humidity measurements suggests that heterogeneous freezing was the dominant formation mechanism of these clouds.",

Compliance with these Technical Regulations has been mandatory since 10 December, 2010 for space operations by French space operators and for space operations conducted on French territory. The space safety requirements and regulations governing procedures are based on national and international best practices and experience. A critical design review of the space system and procedures shall be carried out by applicant space operators, in order to verify compliance with the Technical Regulations. An independent technical assessment of the operation is delegated to CNES. The principles applied when drafting the Technical Regulations are as follows: requirements must, as far as possible, establish the rules according to the objective to be obtained, rather than how it is to be achieved; requirements must give preference to international standards recognised as being state of the art; requirements must take previous experience into account. The Technical Regulations are divided into three sections covering requirements common to the launch, control and return of a space object. A special section will cover specific rules to be applied at the Guiana Space Centre. The main topics addressed by the Technical Regulations are: operator safety management system; study of risks to people, property, public health and the Earth's environment; impact study on the outer space environment: space debris generated by the operation; planetary protection. The first version of the Technical Regulations [2], issued in March 2011, is dedicated to unmanned space systems. © 2012 IAA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

    "abstract": "The science associated with the use of airborne and satellite Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) to remotely sense forest structure has rapidly progressed over the past decade. LiDAR has evolved from being a poorly understood, potentially useful tool to an operational technology in a little over a decade, and these instruments have become a major success story in terms of their application to the measurement, mapping, or monitoring of forests worldwide. Invented in 1960, the laser and, a short time later, LiDAR, were found in research and military laboratories. Since the early 2000s, commercial technological developments coupled with an improved understanding of how to manipulate and analyze large amounts of collected data enabled notable scientific and application developments. A diversity of rapidly developing fields especially benefit from communications offered through conferences such as SilviLaser, and LiDAR has been no different. In 2002 the SilviLaser conference series was initiated to bring together those interested in the development and application of LiDAR for forested environments. Now, a little over a decade later, commercial use of LiDAR is common. In this paper - using the deliberations of SilviLaser 2012 as a source of information - we aim to capture aspects of importance to LiDAR users in the forest ecosystems community and to also point to key emerging issues as well as some remaining challenges. © 2013 Government of Canada.",

    "abstract": "The following paper reports the results of a research work carried from 2008 on the topic of strategies and determinants of space technology Transfer (TT). In particular, the aim of this study is to present: 1. The policies and strategies the major space agencies adopt for TT, 2. The operational mechanisms and determinants involved in the transfer of space technologies to other industrial sectors. To this extent we have conducted in the last five years: six case studies of large space agencies, four TT case studies concerning the construction of scientific satellites, two case studies focused on space to earth TT programs undertaken by the Japanese aerospace agency, and two TT case studies examining Italian space companies.The comparative and comprehensive analyses of these studies indicate that the space agencies of the more industrialized countries aim primarily at consolidating and developing the industrial systems in their own countries, which include the use of technology transfer programs, and that the transfer of space technologies follows the route \"Earth-Space-Earth\". With regard to the determinants of the TT process, the most important of these correlate with the type of technology in transfer, whereas organizational, economic and financial determinants have less significance. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

Major non-European space-faring nations, China and India will progressively play an important role besides US, Russia and Japan. The Space Advisory Group of the European Commission recommended that the European Commission supports within Horizon 2020 a comprehensive Robotic Mars-Exploration Programme under European leadership that should become an essential element of a coordinated international space research programme. The International Space Station (ISS) experience shows that cooperative space programmes build links between industries and laboratories from around the world, which then further develop in non-space related activities, with positive impact on the economy and scientific research. Strategies need to be developed to mitigate the gradual increasing risks incurred by climate change. In order to lower their entry barrier to engage in space emerging and developing space nations need to be included in cooperative space programmes.

    "abstract": "Global commons are areas and resources defined as being beyond sovereign jurisdiction. They are socially constructed and this article identifies four: the high seas and deep seabed, Antarctica, outer space and the global atmosphere although attempts to designate new areas as commons are also noted. The construction of global commons, it is argued, has been determined by shifts in human knowledge, capability and perceptions of scarcity. The commons problem, as defined by Hardin and other analysts arises from the ecological consequences of open access, but also from the renewed concerns of strategists about the military use of common spaces. In the international system a primary response has been to extend sovereignty and the degree to which the global commons have been enclosed is assessed. An alternative model is provided by the negotiation of common heritage status, but since the experiment with the deep sea bed this has not found favour in the Arctic, Antarctic and elsewhere. In terms of the continuing management of the commons the international community has resorted to an array of regulatory regimes of varying coverage and effectiveness. © 2012 London School of Economics and Political Science and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",

    "abstract": "We present new coarse resolution (0.5 &times; 0.5 ) vegetation height and vegetation-cover fraction data sets between 60° S and 60° N for use in climate models and ecological models. The data sets are derived from 2003-2009 measurements collected by the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) on the Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat), the only LiDAR instrument that provides close to global coverage. Initial vegetation height is calculated from GLAS data using a development of the model of Rosette et al. (2008) with with further calibration on desert sites. Filters are developed to identify and eliminate spurious observations in the GLAS data, e.g. data that are affected by clouds, atmosphere and terrain and as such result in erroneous estimates of vegetation height or vegetation cover. Filtered GLAS vegetation height estimates are aggregated in histograms from 0 to 70 m in 0.5 m intervals for each 0.5 &times; 0.5 . The GLAS vegetation height product is evaluated in four ways. Firstly, the Vegetation height data and data filters are evaluated using aircraft LiDAR measurements of the same for ten sites in the Americas, Europe, and Australia. Application of filters to the GLAS vegetation height estimates increases the correlation with aircraft data from <i>r</i> Combining double low line 0.33 to <i>r</i> Combining double low line 0.78, decreases the root-mean-square error by a factor 3 to about 6 m (RMSE) or 4.5 m (68% error distribution) and decreases the bias from 5.7 m to -1.3 m. Secondly, the global aggregated GLAS vegetation height product is tested for sensitivity towards the choice of data quality filters; areas with frequent cloud cover and areas with steep terrain are the most sensitive to the choice of thresholds for the filters. The changes in height estimates by applying different filters are, for the main part, smaller than the overall uncertainty of 4.5-6 m established from the site measurements. Thirdly, the GLAS global vegetation height product is compared with a global vegetation height product typically used in a climate model, a recent global tree height product, and a vegetation greenness product and is shown to produce realistic estimates of vegetation height. Finally, the GLAS bare soil cover fraction is compared globally with the MODIS bare soil fraction (<i>r</i> Combining double low line 0.65) and with bare soil cover fraction estimates derived from AVHRR NDVI data (<i>r</i> Combining double low line 0.67); the GLAS tree-cover fraction is compared with the MODIS tree-cover fraction (<i>r</i> Combining double low line 0.79). The evaluation indicates that filters applied to the GLAS data are conservative and eliminate a large proportion of spurious data, while only in a minority of cases at the cost of removing reliable data as well. <br><br> The new GLAS vegetation height product appears more realistic than previous data sets used in climate models and ecological models and hence should significantly improve simulations that involve the land surface. © Author(s) 2012.",

    "abstract": "The growth of new space systems and the continued creation of orbital debris could in a few years make activities in Earth orbit unsustainable, so finding cost-effective ways to sustain space activities in Earth orbit is essential. Because outer space activities serve the needs of the military-intelligence, civil, and commercial communities, each with their own requirements, creating the necessary international agreements for reaching and maintaining a condition of sustainability will not be easy. This paper summarizes the primary issues for the international space community regarding our future ability to reap the benefit of space systems in Earth orbit. It explores several of the efforts to develop international agreements that would lead to or support the sustainability of space activities and examines the benefits and drawbacks of each approach. In particular, it reviews progress within the UN COPUOS, and examines the EU's proposal for an international Code of Conduct for Outer Space Activities. It also notes the need for states to establish or expand their own space legal infrastructure to conform to the UN treaties and guidelines for space activities. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

    "abstract": "Orbital debris in low Earth orbit (LEO) are now sufficiently dense that the use of LEO space is threatened by runaway collision cascading. A problem predicted more than thirty years ago, the threat from debris larger than about 1 cm demands serious attention. A promising proposed solution uses a high power pulsed laser system on the Earth to make plasma jets on the objects, slowing them slightly, and causing them to re-enter and burn up in the atmosphere. In this paper, we reassess this approach in light of recent advances in low-cost, light-weight modular design for large mirrors, calculations of laser-induced orbit changes and in design of repetitive, multi-kilojoules lasers, that build on inertial fusion research. These advances now suggest that laser orbital debris removal (LODR) is the most cost-effective way to mitigate the debris problem. No other solutions have been proposed that address the whole problem of large and small debris. A LODR system will have multiple uses beyond debris removal. International cooperation will be essential for building and operating such a system. © 2012 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

As a result, empirical estimates are typically made to characterize attributes such as height, volume, or biomass, with known asymptotic relationships as signal saturation occurs. Lidar (light detection and ranging) has emerged as a robust means to collect and subsequently characterize vertically distributed attributes. Lidar has been established as an appropriate data source for forest inventory purposes; however, large area monitoring and mapping activities with lidar remain challenging due to the logistics, costs, and data volumes involved.The use of lidar as a sampling tool for large-area estimation may mitigate some or all of these problems. A number of factors drive, and are common to, the use of airborne profiling, airborne scanning, and spaceborne lidar systems as sampling tools for measuring and monitoring forest resources across areas that range in size from tens of thousands to millions of square kilometers. In this communication, we present the case for lidar sampling as a means to enable timely and robust large-area characterizations. We briefly outline the nature of different lidar systems and data, followed by the theoretical and statistical underpinnings for lidar sampling. Current applications are presented and the future potential of using lidar in an integrated sampling framework for large area ecosystem characterization and monitoring is presented. We also include recommendations regarding statistics, lidar sampling schemes, applications (including data integration and stratification), and subsequent information generation. © 2012.",

    "abstract": "UNCOPUOS recently celebrated its 50th anniversary and has a range of achievements to show for it. But it is now very different - in both type and number of members - from the organization established at the start of the Cold War and needs to consider its future direction. An obvious topic to pursue is the long-term sustainability (LTS) of space activities, which, after some false starts, has now been adopted. One Working, and Four Expert, Groups have been set up to examine different aspects of the subject, though care must be taken to ensure that these are properly integrated into a multidisciplinary framework. Despite valid objections that LTS could be used to deny access to space to latecomers to the club, it is important to proceed with LTS while taking account of delegations' concerns. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

Various arguments are advanced for this, but they are generally not compelling and rely mostly on pointing to the existence of other regional space cooperation organisations, or to benefits that are debatable. The article considers these arguments and concludes that there is an insufficient case for the establishment of an African space agency at this point in the development of the space arena in Africa. Instead, greater emphasis should be placed on strengthening nascent national space programmes, fostering intra-regional cooperation and raising the profile of space activities in Africa's national and regional political structures. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

    "abstract": "This paper surveys recent and current advancements of laser-induced ablation technology for space-based applications and discusses ways of bringing such applications to fruition. Laser ablation is achieved by illuminating a given material with a laser light source. The high surface power densities provided by the laser enable the illuminated material to sublimate and ablate. Possible applications include the deflection of Near Earth Objects - asteroids and comets - from an Earth-impacting event, the vaporisation of space structures and debris, the mineral and material extraction of asteroids and/or as an energy source for future propulsion systems. This paper will discuss each application and the technological advancements that are required to make laser-induced ablation a practical process for use within the space arena. Particular improvements include the efficiency of high power lasers, the collimation of the laser beam (including beam quality) and the power conversion process. These key technological improvements are seen as strategic and merit greater political and commercial support. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

    "abstract": "Historically, computer simulations of the near-Earth space debris environment have provided a basis for international debris mitigation guidelines and, today, continue to influence international debate on debris environment remediation and active debris removal. Approximately 22,500 objects larger than 10 cm are known to exist in Earth orbit, and less than 5% of these are operational payloads, with the remaining population classed as space debris. These objects represent a significant risk to satellite operations because of the possibility of damaging or catastrophic collisions, as demonstrated by the collision between Iridium 33 and Cosmos 2251 in February 2009. Indeed, recent computer simulations have suggested that the current population in low Earth orbit (LEO) has reached a sufficient density at some altitudes for collision activity there to continue even in the absence of new launches. Even with the widespread adoption of debris mitigation guidelines, the growth of the LEO population, in particular, is expected to result in eight or nine collisions among cataloged objects in the next 40 years. With a new study using the University of Southampton's space debris model, entitled DAMAGE, we show that the effectiveness of debris mitigation and removal strategies to constrain the growth of the LEO debris population could be more than halved because of a long-term future decline in global thermospheric density. However, increasing debris remediation efforts can reverse the impact of this negative density trend. Copyright 2011 by the American Geophysical Union.",

    "abstract": "Environmental life cycle assessment (LCA) has developed fast over the last three decades. Whereas LCA developed from merely energy analysis to a comprehensive environmental burden analysis in the 1970s, full-fledged life cycle impact assessment and life cycle costing models were introduced in the 1980s and 1990s, and social-LCA and particularly consequential LCA gained ground in the first decade of the 21st century. Many of the more recent developments were initiated to broaden traditional environmental LCA to a more comprehensive Life Cycle Sustainability Analysis (LCSA). Recently, a framework for LCSA was suggested linking life cycle sustainability questions to knowledge needed for addressing them, identifying available knowledge and related models, knowledge gaps, and defining research programs to fill these gaps. LCA is evolving into LCSA, which is a transdisciplinary integration framework of models rather than a model in itself. LCSA works with a plethora of disciplinary models and guides selecting the proper ones, given a specific sustainability question. Structuring, selecting, and making the plethora of disciplinary models practically available in relation to different types of life cycle sustainability questions is the main challenge. © 2010 American Chemical Society.",

    "abstract": "Human and natural forces are rapidly modifying the global distribution and structure of terrestrial ecosystems on which all of life depends, altering the global carbon cycle, affecting our climate now and for the foreseeable future, causing steep reductions in species diversity, and endangering Earth's sustainability.To understand changes and trends in terrestrial ecosystems and their functioning as carbon sources and sinks, and to characterize the impact of their changes on climate, habitat and biodiversity, new space assets are urgently needed to produce high spatial resolution global maps of the three-dimensional (3D) structure of vegetation, its biomass above ground, the carbon stored within and the implications for atmospheric green house gas concentrations and climate. These needs were articulated in a 2007 National Research Council (NRC) report (NRC, 2007) recommending a new satellite mission, DESDynI, carrying an L-band Polarized Synthetic Aperture Radar (Pol-SAR) and a multi-beam lidar (Light RAnging And Detection) operating at 1064. nm. The objectives of this paper are to articulate the importance of these new, multi-year, 3D vegetation structure and biomass measurements, to briefly review the feasibility of radar and lidar remote sensing technology to meet these requirements, to define the data products and measurement requirements, and to consider implications of mission durations. The paper addresses these objectives by synthesizing research results and other input from a broad community of terrestrial ecology, carbon cycle, and remote sensing scientists and working groups. We conclude that:. (1)Current global biomass and 3-D vegetation structure information is unsuitable for both science and management and policy. The only existing global datasets of biomass are approximations based on combining land cover type and representative carbon values, instead of measurements of actual biomass. Current measurement attempts based on radar and multispectral data have low explanatory power outside low biomass areas. There is no current capability for repeatable disturbance and regrowth estimates.(2)The science and policy needs for information on vegetation 3D structure can be successfully addressed by a mission capable of producing (i) a first global inventory of forest biomass with a spatial resolution 1km or finer and unprecedented accuracy (ii) annual global disturbance maps at a spatial resolution of 1ha with subsequent biomass accumulation rates at resolutions of 1km or finer, and (iii) transects of vertical and horizontal forest structure with 30m along-transect measurements globally at 25m spatial resolution, essential for habitat characterization.We also show from the literature that lidar profile samples together with wall-to-wall L-band quad-pol-SAR imagery and ecosystem dynamics models can work together to satisfy these vegetation 3D structure and biomass measurement requirements. Finally we argue that the technology readiness levels of combined pol-SAR and lidar instruments are adequate for space flight. Remaining to be worked out, are the particulars of a lidar/pol-SAR mission design that is feasible and at a minimum satisfies the information and measurement requirement articulated herein. © 2011.",

    "abstract": "Much attention has been paid recently to the issue of removing human-generated space debris from Earth orbit, especially following conclusions reached by both NASA and ESA that mitigating debris is not sufficient, that debris-on-debris and debris-on-active-satellite collisions will continue to generate new debris even without additional launches, and that some sort of active debris removal (ADR) is needed. Several techniques for ADR are technically plausible enough to merit further research and eventually operational testing. However, all ADR technologies present significant legal and policy challenges which will need to be addressed for debris removal to become viable. This paper summarizes the most promising techniques for removing space debris in both LEO and GEO, including electrodynamic tethers and ground- and space-based lasers. It then discusses several of the legal and policy challenges posed, including: lack of separate legal definitions for functional operational spacecraft and non-functional space debris; lack of international consensus on which types of space debris objects should be removed; sovereignty issues related to who is legally authorized to remove pieces of space debris; the need for transparency and confidence-building measures to reduce misperceptions of ADR as anti-satellite weapons; and intellectual property rights and liability with regard to ADR operations. Significant work on these issues must take place in parallel to the technical research and development of ADR techniques, and debris removal needs to be done in an environment of international collaboration and cooperation. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

    "abstract": "Natural resource management (NRM) is becoming increasingly important at all scales, local, regional, national and global, because of an increasing human population and increasing per capita use of resources and space. Conflicts are intensifying between different interest groups. Production and conservation aspects are particularly debated because conservation of ten conflicts with economic and social sustainability. There is public demand for objective decision based NRM but limitations are all pervasive due to the spatial and temporal complexity and interdisciplinary nature. This special issue explores the use of spatial data and models to overcome some limitations of NRM decision making. The papers in this issue show modern approaches of natural resources management with a particular focus on spatial data collection, analysis and the development of spatial indicators. This issue presentsab a lanced mix of review and research papers that give examples of how to find or improve the spatial information base for evidence-based decision making. This overview makes the argument that understanding complex spatial pattern and processes, and the development of spatial indicators, is an essential aspect of evidence-based NRM. If spatial and temporal patterns are complex, ecological evidence from field data or experiments may have limited value for NRM and observational study designs become more appropriate for understanding complex spatial pattern and processes. Data quality should be documented as a combination of accuracy and spatio-temporal representativeness in order to be useful in the NRM decision process. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",

There are, however, monumental technical, resource, operational, legal, and political challenges in making economically viable ADR a reality. Before a consensus on the need for ADR can be reached, a careful analysis of its effectiveness must be conducted. The goal is to demonstrate the need and feasibility of using ADR to better preserve the future environment and to explore different operational options to maximize the benefit-to-cost ratio. This paper describes a new sensitivity study on using ADR to stabilize the future LEO debris environment. The NASA long-term orbital debris evolutionary model, LEGEND, is used to quantify the effects of several key parameters, including target selection criteria/constraints and the starting epoch of ADR implementation. Additional analyses on potential ADR targets among the existing satellites and the benefits of collision avoidance maneuvers are also included. © 2011 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

    "abstract": "This article examines how sustainable marketing could be achieved through the contribution of three existing marketing sub-disciplines; green marketing, social marketing and critical marketing. Green marketing facilitates the development and marketing of more sustainable products and services while introducing sustainability efforts into the core of the marketing process and business practice. Social marketing involves using the power of marketing to encourage sustainable behaviour among individuals, businesses and decision makers while also assessing the impact of current commercial marketing on sustainability. This links into the critical marketing paradigm which entails analyses of marketing theory, principles and techniques using a critical theory based approach. This analysis can help to guide regulation and control, development of marketing theory and practice, and to challenge the dominant institutions associated with marketing and the capitalist system, encouraging a marketing system in which sustainability is a key goal. The article concludes by offering a framework for sustainable marketing and a way forward for how this might be achieved. © The Author(s) 2011.",

    "abstract": "As humanity prepares to extend its reach beyond low-Earth-orbit for the first time since the 1970s, a new symbol of international cooperation is needed to further promote the message of peace and collaboration such exploration entails. The space race that occurred between the USSR and the USA is an ill-suited model for long-term sustained space exploration because it is too costly and too resource-intensive for a single nation to bear. While competition is healthy for technology development, the success of a sustained space exploration strategy lies beyond technological capabilities. It lies in international cooperation, space policy, and public support. Without these, no program can realistically achieve a sustained presence in space beyond low-Earth orbit. To this effect, this paper proposes a cost-effective first step in the form of a universal symbol which, when placed alongside national flags displayed on hardware and astronaut/cosmonaut/taikonaut flight-suits, would send a strong message to the world that space exploration is done for the benefit of humanity as a whole, not just for spacefaring nations. The \" Blue Marble\" , the first complete picture of Earth taken from space by humans in 1972, fits this universally appealing symbol. This symbol requires no political collaboration between countries, yet is an image that anyone, anywhere in the world, can relate to regardless of nationality, ethnic origin or religious beliefs. Placed on the shoulder pads of human 'nauts - ambassadors of planet Earth - or prominently displayed on spacebound hardware, this symbol would send a universal message to present and future generations that, in space, our planet is working together for the benefit of everyone. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",

    "abstract": "The global commercial aircraft fleet in 2006 flew 31.26 million flights, burned 188.20 million metric tons of fuel, and covered 38.68 billion kilometers. This activity emitted substantial amounts of fossil-fuel combustion products within the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere that affect atmospheric composition and climate. The emissions products, such as carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, sulfur compounds, and particulate matter, are not emitted uniformly over the Earth, so understanding the temporal and spatial distributions is important for modeling aviation's climate impacts. Global commercial aircraft emission data for 2004 and 2006, provided by the Volpe National Transportation Systems Center, were computed using the Federal Aviation Administration's Aviation Environmental Design Tool (AEDT). Continuous improvement in methodologies, including changes in AEDT's horizontal track methodologies, and an increase in availability of data make some differences between the 2004 and 2006 inventories incomparable. Furthermore, the 2004 inventory contained a significant over-count due to an imperfect data merge and daylight savings error. As a result, the 2006 emissions inventory is considered more representative of actual flight activity. Here, we analyze both 2004 and 2006 emissions, focusing on the latter, and provide corrected totals for 2004. Analysis of 2006 flight data shows that 92.5% of fuel was burned in the Northern Hemisphere, 69.0% between 30N and 60N latitudes, and 74.6% was burned above 7 km. This activity led to 162.25 Tg of carbon from CO2 emitted globally in 2006, more than half over three regions: the United States (25.5%), Europe (14.6), and East Asia (11.1). Despite receiving less than one percent of global emissions, the Arctic receives a uniformly dispersed concentration of emissions with 95.2% released at altitude where they have longer residence time than surface emissions. Finally, 85.2% of all flights by number in 2006 were short-haul missions, yet those flights were responsible for only 39.7% of total carbon from CO2. The following is a summary of these data which illustrates the global and regional aviation emissions footprints for 2004 and 2006, and provides temporal and spatial distribution statistics. © Author(s) 2010.",

It is the first one that: (i) operates at 355 nm for emitting energetic pulses of 16 mJ at 20 Hz while fulfilling eye-safety regulations and (ii) is flown onboard an ultra-light airplane for enhanced flight flexibility. Laser footprints at ground level were 2.4 m wide for a flying altitude of 300 m. Three test areas of ~500 × 500 m2 with Maritime pines of different ages were investigated. We used a threshold method adapted for this lidar to accurately extract from its waveforms detailed forest canopy vertical structure: canopy top, tree crown base and undergrowth heights. Good detection sensitivity enabled the observation of ground returns underneath the trees. Statistical and one-to-one comparisons with ground measurements by field foresters indicated a mean absolute accuracy of ~1 m. Sensitivity tests on detection threshold showed the importance of signal to noise ratio and footprint size for a proper detection of the canopy vertical structure. This UV-lidar is intended for future innovative applications of simultaneous observation of forest canopy, laser-induced vegetation fluorescence and atmospheric aerosols. © 2010 by the authors.",

The choice of the Landes forest in southwestern France as study area was made regarding the flat topography of the area and the stand height consistency. We chose three plots from different stands (different height characteristics) and compared the lidar derived metrics to field measurements. To derive metrics from lidar data, we summed the lidar waveforms within a plot and calculated derived reflectance profiles to correct the lidar signal from the occlusion effect. We then retrieve plot mean total and mean crown base heights measurement from reflectance profiles. We obtain a good consistency of the lidar measurements compared to field measurements, even if we noticed the existence of a 5 to 10% bias probably linked to the lidar sampling strategy. © 2010 IEEE.",

The same input datasets and sampling design are used in conjunction with four different predictive models to estimate total aboveground dry forest biomass and forest carbon. The four models include non-stratified and stratified versions of a multiple linear model where either biomass or (biomass)0.5 serves as the dependent variable. The use of different models in Québec introduces differences in Provincial dry biomass estimates of up to 0.35 G, with a range of 4.94 ± 0.28 Gt to 5.29 ± 0.36 Gt. The differences among model estimates are statistically non-significant, however, and the results demonstrate the degree to which carbon estimates vary strictly as a function of the model used to estimate regional biomass. Results also indicate that GLAS measurements become problematic with respect to height and biomass retrievals in the boreal forest when biomass values fall below 20 t ha-1 and when GLAS 75th percentile heights fall below 7 m.",

The plan is aimed at UNFCCC non-Annex 1 developing countries, but the principles outlined are also applicable to developed (Annex 1) countries. The parts of the plan are: (1) Expand the number of national forest carbon Measuring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) systems with a priority on tropical developing countries; (2) Implement continuous global forest carbon assessments through the network of national systems; (3) Achieve commitments from national space agencies for the necessary satellite data; (4) Establish agreed-on standards and independent verification processes to ensure robust reporting; and (5) Enhance coordination among international and multilateral organizations. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.",

NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has developed an operational collision risk assessment process to protect NASA's high-value unmanned (robotic) assets that has been in use since January 2005. This paper provides an overview of the NASA robotic conjunction assessment process, including descriptions of the new tools developed to analyze close approach data and of the risk mitigation strategies employed.

    "abstract": "A new type of hydrocarbon rocket engine is expected to power a fleet of suborbital rockets for commercial and scientific purposes in coming decades. A global climate model predicts that emissions from a fleet of 1000 launches per year of suborbital rockets would create a persistent layer of black carbon particles in the northern stratosphere that could cause potentially significant changes in the global atmospheric circulation and distributions of ozone and temperature. Tropical stratospheric ozone abundances are predicted to change as much as 1%, while polar ozone changes by up to 6%. Polar surface temperatures change as much as one degree K regionally with significant impacts on polar sea ice fractions. After one decade of continuous launches, globally averaged radiative forcing from the black carbon would exceed the forcing from the emitted CO<inf>2</inf> by a factor of about 10<sup>5</sup> and would be comparable to the radiative forcing estimated from current subsonic aviation. © 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.",

    "abstract": "Although many companies investigate sustainability management and publish sustainability reports, their main focus in this endeavour remains unclear. Often, it seems that sustainability issues are pursued more coincidentally than with a clear strategy. On one hand, research is done for the identification and determination of distinct aspects concerning economic, ecological and social dimensions of sustainability. Guidelines to develop a sustainability report are popular examples of this. On the other hand, scientific effort is recognizable regarding the establishment of specific sustainability strategies, e.g. strategies that focus on internal/external orientation of sustainability commitment. Strategies should be designed to work to improve performance in terms of the issues identified, but in many cases the link between aspects and sustainability strategies is missing in practice. This paper aims to narrow this gap by developing specific aspect profiles for sustainability strategies. Relating to the characteristics of various sustainability strategies, key sustainability issues are determined, which have to be implemented in order to reach defined sustainability goals efficiently. The paper helps companies that already commit to sustainability to verify whether they are consistent in the implementation of a distinct sustainability strategy. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.",

While new cooperative mechanisms have emerged in recent decades, the now-unfolding era of global space exploration will lead to new models of cooperation, reflecting the legacy of partnerships and the evolution of a global endeavor. Consequently, the successful alignment of national and international stakeholders along lines drawn by commonality of purpose will be crucial to achieve a basis for marshalling sufficient resources for ambitious space projects, and to create necessary new political, economic, and legal frameworks. For the development of a successful global space exploration program, traditional approaches may need to be supplanted by a new paradigm including focus on information exchange, organizational knowledge, and human capital - as practiced in high-performance organizations (HPOs) - that go well beyond the current international working groups and multinational space efforts. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.",

    "abstract": "We model the orbital debris environment by a set of differential equations with parameter values that capture many of the complexities of existing three-dimensional simulation models. We compute the probability that a spacecraft gets destroyed in a collision during its operational lifetime, and then define the sustainable risk level as the maximum of this probability over all future time. Focusing on the 900- to 1000-km altitude region, which is the most congested portion of low Earth orbit, we find that - despite the initial rise in the level of fragments - the sustainable risk remains below 10 - 3 if there is high (>98%) compliance to the existing 25-year postmission deorbiting guideline. We quantify the damage (via the number of future destroyed operational spacecraft) generated by past and future space activities. We estimate that the 2007 FengYun 1C antisatellite weapon test represents ≈ 1 % of the legacy damage due to space objects having a characteristic size of ≥ 10 cm, and causes the same damage as failing to deorbit 2.6 spacecraft after their operational life. Although the political and economic issues are daunting, these damage estimates can be used to help determine one-time legacy fees and fees on future activities (including deorbit noncompliance), which can deter future debris generation, compensate operational spacecraft that are destroyed in future collisions, and partially fund research and development into space debris mitigation technologies. Our results need to be confirmed with a high-fidelity three-dimensional model before they can provide the basis for any major decisions made by the space community. © 2009 COSPAR.",

    "abstract": "ESA's Space Debris Office provides an operational service for the assessment of collision risks of ESA satellites. Currently, the ENVISAT and ERS-2 missions in low Earth orbits are covered by this service. If an upcoming high-risk conjunction event is predicted based on analysis of Two-Line Element (TLE) data from the US Space Surveillance Network, then independent tracking data of the potential high-risk conjunction object are acquired to improve the knowledge of its orbit. This improved knowledge and the associated small error covariances derived from the orbit determination process scale down the position error ellipsoid at the conjunction epoch. Hence, for the same miss-distance, in most cases an avoidance manoeuvre can be suppressed with an acceptable residual risk. During the past years sophisticated stand-alone tools have been developed and maintained at ESA's Space Debris Office. The central tools for analysing conjunction events are the collision risk assessment software CRASS and the orbit determination software ODIN. ODIN is used to process tracking data and to determine orbits by least-squares fits of tracking data, or of pseudo-data in terms of osculating orbit states, which can for instance be derived from TLEs. On this basis, estimates of TLE error covariances also can be established as input for initial collision risk assessments. For ESA's automated routine conjunction event assessments which are embedded in a daily process with 7-day predictions, the handling of high-risk events is work-intensive. This shortcoming has been addressed by the implementation of a job scheduler, and automated procedures to facilitate the processing of tracking data, the update of ephemerides and covariances, and the update of conjunction geometries and collision risk estimates. The application of the upgraded software environment is illustrated through two exemplary, recent conjunction events of ENVISAT (02009A) with Russian Cosmos satellites: the conjunction event on 2008-Jan-09 19:00 (UTC) with the chaser object COSMOS-1624 (85006A), and the conjunction event on 2007-Nov-14 13:49 (UTC) with the chaser object COSMOS-1486 (83079A). © 2009 COSPAR.",

    "abstract": "We obtained spatially extensive canopy height measurements using airborne remote sensing to characterize the structure and dynamics of a tropical rain forest landscape. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is a remote-sensing technology that acquires measurements of canopy height and ground elevation. By recording the return time of laser pulses emitted by aircraft-mounted sensors, LiDAR systems quantify the structure and geometry of individual trees and canopy height and enable estimation of the vertical and horizontal distribution of biomass using millions of accurate height measurements. This data set contains 127 849 839 records from 128 square kilometers of tropical wet forest in the Atlantic lowlands of Costa Rica (mean sampling density is 1.99 observations/m2). The study area includes all 16 square kilometers of mixed-land-use forest at the La Selva Biological Station and the lower flanks of Braulio Carrillo National Park. It contains a mosaic of historical and contemporary land use that is representative of contemporary tropical forest landscapes. Field studies demonstrated that LiDAR measurements were precise and accurate throughout the topographic and structural conditions at the site. Each record includes: easting and northing mapped coordinates (UTM Zone 16 North), height above ground (m), interpolated ground elevation (m), and six remote-sensing descriptors (point classification, the return number, the number of returns for the given pulse, intensity, scan angle, and the time of emission of the laser pulse). The data can be applied to a wide range of questions in basic andapplied science, and are a valuable resource from a well-studied tropical rain forest for teaching and education.They also provide a quantitative baseline against which futureconditions can be assessed.",

    "abstract": "In their efforts to deal with global climate change, scientists and governments have given much attention to the carbon emissions associated with fossil fuels and to strategies for reducing their use. While it is very important to burn less fossil fuel and to employ alternative energy sources, other carbon-reduction options must also be considered. Given that forests comprise a large portion of the global landbase and that they play a very significant role in the global carbon cycle, it is logical to examine how forest management practices could effect reductions in carbon emissions. Many papers that discuss forest carbon sinks or sources refer only to the short term (<20 years). This paper focuses on the sustainable carbon storage contributions of a forest over the long term. This paper explains that long-term carbon storage and reduced carbon fluctuation can be achieved by a combination of improved forest management and efficient transfer of carbon into wood products. Here we show how three different forest management scenarios affect the overall carbon storage capacity of forest and wood products combined over the long term. We used a timber supply model and scenario analysis to predict forest carbon and other resource conditions over time in the Prince George Forest District, a 3.4-million-ha landbase in northern British Columbia. We found that the high-harvest scenario stores 3% more carbon than the low-harvest scenario and 27% (120 million tonnes) more carbon than the no-harvest scenario even though only 1.2-million ha is in timber harvesting landbase. Our results tell us that forest management practices that maintain and increase forest area, reduce natural disturbances in the forest, improve forest conditions, and ensure the appropriate and timely transfer of carbon into wood products lead to increasing overall carbon storage, thereby reducing carbon in the atmosphere. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Timber volume estimates are generated for 16 forest classes, i.e., four forest cover types × four canopy density classes, across this 811,414 km2 area and compared with a ground-based regional volume estimate. Two regional GLAS/MODIS timber volume products, one considering only those pulses falling on slopes ≤ 10° and one utilizing all GLAS pulses regardless of slope, are generated. Using a two-phase(GLAS-ground plot) sampling design, GLAS/MODIS volumes average 163.4 ± 11.8 m3/ha across all 16 forest classes based on GLAS pulses on slopes ≤ 10° and 171.9 ± 12.4 m3/ha considering GLAS shots on all slopes. The increase in regional GLAS volume per-hectare estimates as a function of increasing slope most likely illustrate the effects of vertical waveform expansion due to the convolution of topography with the forest canopy response. A comparable, independent, ground-based estimate is 146 m3/ha [Shepashenko, D., Shvidenko, A., and Nilsson, S. (1998). Phytomass (live biomass) and carbon of Siberian forests. Biomass and Bioenergy, 14, 21-31], a difference of 11.9% and 17.7% for GLAS shots on slopes ≤ 10° and all GLAS shots regardless of slope, respectively. A ground-based estimate of total volume for the entire study area, 7.46 × 109 m3, is derived using Shepashenko et al.'s per-hectare volume estimate in conjunction with forest area derived from a 1990 forest map [Grasia, M.G.

    "abstract": "On 11 January 2007, the People's Republic of China conducted a successful anti-satellite test against one of their defunct polar-orbiting weather satellites. The target satellite, called Fengyun-1C, had a mass of 880 kg and was orbiting at an altitude of about 863 km when the collision occurred. Struck by a direct-ascent interceptor at a speed of 9.36 km/s, the satellite disintegrated, spreading the cataloged fragments between 200 and 4000 km, with the highest concentration near the breakup height. By the end of April 2008, 2377 pieces of debris, including the original payload remnant, had officially been cataloged by the US Space Surveillance Network. Of these, nearly 1% had reentered the Earth's atmosphere. This deliberate act is the largest debris-generating event on record, and its consequences will adversely affect circumterrestrial space for many years. In an attempt to assess the impact of the Fengyun-1C breakup on the low Earth environment, the cloud of cataloged debris was propagated for nearly 8 years, taking into account the relevant orbit perturbations and a debris cloud ballistic coefficient distribution based on orbit decay calibrations. The immediate consequence of the Chinese anti-satellite test was to significantly increase the probability of collision with man-made debris. For the Italian spacecraft launched in the first half of 2007, the collision probability with cataloged objects increased by 10% for AGILE, in equatorial orbit, and by 60% for COSMO-SkyMed 1 and 2, in sun-synchronous orbit. During the next few years, the debris cloud generated by the Fengyun-1C breakup was found to remain relatively stable, with nearly 80% of the cataloged fragments still in orbit about 9 years after the event. © 2009 COSPAR.",

    "abstract": "Aboveground dry biomass was estimated for the 1.3 M km2 forested area south of the treeline in the eastern Canadian province of Québec by combining data from an airborne and spaceborne LiDAR, a Landsat ETM+ land cover map, a Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model, ground inventory plots, and vegetation zone maps. Plot-level biomass was calculated using allometric relationships between tree attributes and biomass. A small footprint portable laser profiler then flew over these inventory plots to develop a generic airborne LiDAR-based biomass equation (R2 = 0.65, n = 207). The same airborne LiDAR system flew along four portions of orbits of the ICESat Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS). A square-root transformed equation was developed to predict airborne profiling LiDAR estimates of aboveground dry biomass from GLAS waveform parameters combined with an SRTM slope index (R2 = 0.59, n = 1325). Using the 104,044 quality-filtered GLAS pulses obtained during autumn 2003 from 97 orbits over the study area, we then predicted aboveground dry biomass for the main vegetation areas of Québec as well as for the entire Province south of the treeline. Including cover type covariances both within and between GLAS orbits increased standard errors of the estimates by two to five times at the vegetation zone level and as much as threefold at the provincial level. Aboveground biomass for the whole study area averaged 39.0 ± 2.2 (standard error) Mg ha- 1 and totalled 4.9 ± 0.3 Pg. Biomass distributions were 12.6% northern hardwoods, 12.6% northern mixedwood, 38.4% commercial boreal, 13% non-commercial boreal, 14.2% taiga, and 9.2% treed tundra. Non-commercial forests represented 36% of the estimated aboveground biomass, thus highlighting the importance of remote northern forests to C sequestration. This study has shown that space-based forest inventories of northern forests could be an efficient way of estimating the amount, distribution, and uncertainty of aboveground biomass and carbon stocks at large spatial scales. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.",

    "abstract": "Regression models relating variables derived from airborne laser scanning (ALS) to above-ground and below-ground biomass were estimated for 1395 sample plots in young and mature coniferous forest located in ten different areas within the boreal forest zone of Norway. The sample plots were measured as part of large-scale operational forest inventories. Four different ALS instruments were used and point density varied from 0.7 to 1.2 m- 2. One variable related to canopy height and one related to canopy density were used as independent variables in the regressions. The statistical effects of area and age class were assessed by including dummy variables in the models. Tree species composition was treated as continuous variables. The proportion of explained variability was 88% for above- and 85% for below-ground biomass models. For given combinations of ALS-derived variables, the differences between the areas were up to 32% for above-ground biomass and 38% for below-ground biomass. The proportion of spruce had a significant impact on both the estimated models. The proportion of broadleaves had a significant effect on above-ground biomass only, while the effect of age class was significant only in the below-ground biomass model. Because of local effects on the biomass-ALS data relationships, it is indicated by this study that sample plots distributed over the entire area would be needed when using ALS for regional or national biomass monitoring. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

This paper reviews the methods of small-footprint airborne laser scanning for extracting forest inventory data, mainly in the boreal forest zone. The methods are divided into the following categories: extraction of terrain and canopy height model; feature extraction approaches (canopy height distribution and individual-tree-based techniques, techniques based on the synergetic use of aerial images and lidar, and other new approaches); tree species classification and forest growth using laser scanner; and the use of intensity and waveform data in forest information extraction. Despite this, the focus is on methods, some review of quality obtained, especially in the boreal forest area, is included. Several recommendations for future research are given to foster the methodology development.",

    "abstract": "Forest inventory data often provide the required base data to enable the large area mapping of biomass over a range of scales. However, spatially explicit estimates of above-ground biomass (AGB) over large areas may be limited by the spatial extent of the forest inventory relative to the area of interest (i.e., inventories not spatially exhaustive), or by the omission of inventory attributes required for biomass estimation. These spatial and attributional gaps in the forest inventory may result in an underestimation of large area AGB. The continuous nature and synoptic coverage of remotely sensed data have led to their increased application for AGB estimation over large areas, although the use of these data remains challenging in complex forest environments. In this paper, we present an approach to generating spatially explicit estimates of large area AGB by integrating AGB estimates from multiple data sources; 1. using a lookup table of conversion factors applied to a non-spatially exhaustive forest inventory dataset (R2 = 0.64; RMSE = 16.95 t/ha), 2. applying a lookup table to unique combinations of land cover and vegetation density outputs derived from remotely sensed data (R2 = 0.52; RMSE = 19.97 t/ha), and 3. hybrid mapping by augmenting forest inventory AGB estimates with remotely sensed AGB estimates where there are spatial or attributional gaps in the forest inventory data. Over our 714,852 ha study area in central Saskatchewan, Canada, the AGB estimate generated from the forest inventory was approximately 40 Mega tonnes (Mt); however, the inventory estimate represents only 51% of the total study area. The AGB estimate generated from the remotely sensed outputs that overlap those made from the forest inventory based approach differ by only 2 %; however in total, the remotely sensed estimate is 30 % greater (58 Mt) than the estimate generated from the forest inventory when the entire study area is accounted for. Finally, using the hybrid approach, whereby the remotely sensed inputs were used to fill spatial gaps in the forest inventory, the total AGB for the study area was estimated at 62 Mt. In the example presented, data integration facilitates comprehensive and spatially explicit estimation of AGB for the entire study area. © 2008 by MDPI.",

    "abstract": "In September 2003 the Group of Astrodynamics of the University of Rome \"La Sapienza\" (GAUSS) carried out a two-site optical observation campaign addressed to the orbit determination of objects in the geosynchronous region without a priori information. Two 40 cm aperture Ritchey-Chrétien telescopes were employed: the f/7.5 \"Collepardo Automatic Telescope\" (CAT, located in Collepardo, Italy) and an f/5 tube of the \"Observatori Astronòmic de Mallorca\" (OAM, located in Mallorca, Spain). The baseline between the sites is about 1000 km. Three second long, 1 min apart exposures were simultaneously taken in sidereal tracking mode, looking at the same arcs of the geosynchronous ring. The size of the fields of view allowed to see a few satellites in two successive frames from both sites. The Lambert theorem has been exploited to determine the orbits, averaging the data with the least square method in the case that more than 2 points were available. Of course, the longer the time interval between the positions, the lower the effect of measuring errors. Nevertheless, the only way to have quite distant points would be tracking the satellite, but following-up is typically time demanding thus not suitable for a surveillance campaign, hence not very interesting from a practical standpoint. In the paper the results of the orbit determination from the September 2003 campaign are reported. More in detail, the outcomes of some classical methods for solving the Lambert theorem, are compared with solutions based on the measurements fitted with the least squares method, with the circular orbit assumption results, with the one-site complete orbit determination and with the TLEs. © 2006 COSPAR.",

    "abstract": "The use of corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives to influence consumers and differentiate product offerings has become quite common. This research builds on the growing body of marketing literature through two investigations that manipulate consumers' perceptions of fit, motivation, and timing of corporate social initiatives embedded within promotions. We find that low-fit initiatives negatively impact consumer beliefs, attitudes, and intentions no matter what the firm's motivation, and that high-fit initiatives that are profit-motivated have the same impact. Furthermore, consumers consider the timing (proactive versus reactive) of the social initiative as an informational cue, and only the high-fit, proactive initiatives led to an improvement in consumer beliefs, attitudes, and intentions. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of basal area distributions of sample plots in coniferous forest derived from small-footprint airborne laser scanner data, and to compare the accuracy of two methods for derivation of such distributions based on: (1) two percentiles of a two-parameter Weibull and parameter recovery, and (2) a system of 10 percentiles defined across the range of observed diameters. The 12 percentiles were derived from the empirical basal area distributions of 141 plots with size 300-400 m2. Regression analysis was used to relate the percentiles to various canopy height and canopy density metrics derived from the laser data. On average, the distance between transmitted laser pulses was 0.9 m on the ground. The plots were divided into three strata according to age class and site quality. The stratum-specific regressions explained 7-91% of the variability. Total plot volume predicted from the estimated distributions was used to assess the accuracy of the regressions. Cross-validation of the regressions revealed a bias of -1.2 to 2.1% between predicted and ground-truth values of plot volume. The standard deviations of the differences between predicted and ground-truth values of plot volume were 15.1-16.4%. Neither bias nor standard deviation differed significantly between the two validated methods. © 2005 Taylor & Francis.",

The data products of this mission will for the first time accurately estimate aboveground biomass globally, one of the most important parameters of the carbon cycle. Simultaneous acquisition of multiangle optical with Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) observations is unprecedented.

    "abstract": "The Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis postulates an inverted-U-shaped relationship between different pollutants and per capita income, i.e., environmental pressure increases up to a certain level as income goes up; after that, it decreases. An EKC actually reveals how a technically specified measurement of environmental quality changes as the fortunes of a country change. A sizeable literature on EKC has grown in recent period. The common point of all the studies is the assertion that the environmental quality deteriorates at the early stages of economic development/growth and subsequently improves at the later stages. In other words, environmental pressure increases faster than income at early stages of development and slows down relative to GDP growth at higher income levels. This paper reviews some theoretical developments and empirical studies dealing with EKC phenomenon. Possible explanations for this EKC are seen in (i) the progress of economic development, from clean agrarian economy to polluting industrial economy to clean service economy; (ii) tendency of people with higher income having higher preference for environmental quality, etc. Evidence of the existence of the EKC has been questioned from several corners. Only some air quality indicators, especially local pollutants, show the evidence of an EKC. However, an EKC is empirically observed, till there is no agreement in the literature on the income level at which environmental degradation starts declining. This paper provides an overview of the EKC literature, background history, conceptual insights, policy and the conceptual and methodological critique. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

To reduce the risks for future space missions several mitigation strategies have been developed during the last years. In this paper the long-term cost development of space debris mitigation measures is analyzed. Different mitigation scenarios are defined and compared. Cost models are derived for mitigation measures and for the loss of amortization in the case of hypervelocity impacts on operating satellites. Long-term simulations of the space debris environment based on a conservative orbital traffic model have been made for a 50 years time interval beginning in 2001. The simulations consider different mitigation scenarios. The output data have been combined with the cost models. The mitigation scenarios were compared, and a cost-benefit analysis has been performed. The result of the investigation is, that the most effective mitigation measures are passivation (suppression of fragmentation events) and slag prevention. © 2003 International Astronautical Federation.

The aim of this study is to investigate how measures derived from laser scanning data can be used in regression models for estimation of basal-area-weighted mean tree height and stem volume on 10 m radius field plots. Influence of laser scan angle on tree height estimation and on crown coverage area estimation is also investigated. The study area was located in southern Sweden (lat. 58°30′N, long. 13°40′E). The dominating tree species were Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and birch (Betula spp.). Linear regression functions (R2=0.89-0.91) used to predict basal-area-weighted mean tree height had a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.45-1.56 m, corresponding to 10-11% of average height. Scanning angle was not significant for estimation of basal-area-weighted mean tree height. Two regression models were used for prediction of stem volume. The first model (R2 = 0.90), with laser derived mean height together with laser derived crown coverage area as predicting variables, gave RMSEof 37 m3 ha-1, corresponding to 22% of average stem volume. The second model (R2=0.82), with laser derived tree height together with laser derived stem number as predicting variables, gave RMSE of 43 m3 ha-1, corresponding to 26% of average stem volume. The results implies that airborne laser scanning, if combined with a field sample, has potential of retrieving information with high spatial resolution (10 m radius plot) about tree height and stem volume for a forest area.",

    "abstract": "Space activity has lost the momentum it had in the past. During the Cold War the use of space was constrained by specific political and military conditions which gave it a strong but narrow identity. The aerospace industry, in particular, was in a position to develop protected and exclusive ties with the public sector. These times have passed and diminishing competition between the two main space powers has had consequences for the planning of major space undertakings. Space activity is in the process of being thoroughly transformed as it is forced to become more connected to general economic and industrial activity, especially in the field of information. An opportunity for a sector that has been struggling could also prove to be risky as space activity is losing some of its previously strong identity. Space currently seems to lack the high level of public support from governments it once enjoyed, while not finding an alternative in the industry itself to this declining investment. This situation should lead both the space community and the political authorities to consider new general space applications that will be more in line with the preoccupations of our modern societies and thus contribute to solving the principal global issues of tomorrow. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This article discusses how the concept of sustainable development has evolved over the past three decades and particularly how it can be applied to the business level. It then goes on to describe the three types of capital relevant within the concept of corporate sustainability: economic, natural and social capital. From this basis we shall then develop the six criteria managers aiming for corporate sustainability will have to satisfy: eco-efficiency, socio-efficiency, eco-effectiveness, socio-effectiveness, sufficiency and ecological equity.

It recognizes that humanity is inseparable from and dependent on natural systems, and that the growing worldwide population and consumption have damaged, and will increasingly stress, global ecosystems. Ecological engineering is the design of sustainable systems, consistent with ecological principles, which integrate human society with its natural environment for the benefit of both. It recognizes the relationship of organisms (including humans) with their environment and the constraints on design imposed by the complexity, variability and uncertainty inherent to natural systems. Successful ecological engineering will require a design methodology consistent with, if not based on, ecological principles. We identify five design principles to guide those practicing ecological engineering. The principles are: (1) design consistent with ecological principles, (2) design for site-specific context, (3) maintain the independence of design functional requirements, (4) design for efficiency in energy and information, and (5) acknowledge the values and purposes that motivate design. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

    "abstract": "In machine vision, an original gray tone image is processed to produce features that can be used by higher-level processes, such as recognition and inspection procedures. Thresholding the image results in a binary image whose pixels are labeled as foreground or background. Segmenting the image results in a symbolic image whose pixels are assigned labels representing various classifications. In both cases, an important next step in the analysis of the image is an operation called connected component labeling that groups the pixels into regions, such that adjacent pixels have the same label, and pixels belonging to distinct regions have different labels. Properties of the regions and relationships among them may then be calculated. The most common relationship, spatial adjacency, can be represented by a region adjacency graph. This chapter describes algorithms for connected component labeling and region adjacency graph construction. In addition to giving several sequential algorithms for two-dimensional connected component labeling, it also discusses several parallel algorithms and an algorithm for three-dimensional connected component labeling. © 1996 Elsevier B.V.

    "abstract": "This paper describes a computational approach to edge detection. The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of theso-lution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for severalcom-mon image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle be-tween detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient mag-nitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature syn-thesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector perfor-mance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge. This detection scheme uses several elongated operators at each point, and the directional operator outputs are in-tegrated with the gradient maximum detector. © 1986 IEEE",
