   abstract = {The United Nations has addressed the concept of sustainable development on Earth in a number of global summits and fora for the past 40 years. Extending the concept of sustainability to outer space is a much more recent development, arising from the realization that the Earth's orbital space environment constitutes a finite resource that is being used by an increasing number of space actors that include States, commercial actors and other non-governmental entities. The proliferation of space debris, the increasing complexity of space operations, the emergence of large constellations of satellites, and the increased risks of collisions and interference with the operation of satellites raise concerns about the safety of space operations and the long-term sustainability (LTS) of space activities. Addressing these developments and risks requires international cooperation. The leading international forum to discuss questions of international cooperation in space activities is the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UN COPUOS). In 2010, the Committee began its consideration of this topic with a view to producing a set of internationally agreed guidelines that States could follow to ensure that their space activities would not cause harm to the space environment or the safety of space operations. Following a broad international process conducted under the aegis of COPUOS, in June 2019 the Committee adopted a set of 21 voluntary, non-binding UN COPUOS Guidelines for the Long-term Sustainability of Outer Space Activities (‘COPUOS LTS Guidelines’). This paper provides a brief overview of the development of these guidelines, summarizes the salient features of the guidelines and discusses the implementation of these guidelines from the perspectives of government, industry and civil society. In adopting this set of LTS Guidelines, COPUOS acknowledged that more work needs to be done on this topic and it agreed to establish a follow-up LTS working group with a five-year mandate to continue the work. The main themes and challenges facing the next phase of the LTS discussions in COPUOS are also discussed.},

   abstract = {The application of Life Cycle Engineering (LCE) within the concurrent engineering process presents a viable method for assessing environmental, social and economic impacts of space missions. Despite this, the novelty of the concept within space mission design has meant that the approach has not yet been widely implemented. This paper successfully demonstrates this technique for the first time and presents LCE results of three SmallSat missions designed at the University of Strathclyde using the concurrent engineering approach. The Strathclyde Space Systems Database (SSSD) was deployed to calculate the total life cycle impacts of each mission, including the identification of common design hotspots. A novel technique called Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) was also trialled, whereby several impact categories were converted into single scores as a test case to reduce the learning curve for engineers. Overall, the LCE results indicate that the manufacturing & production of the launcher dominate the majority of impact categories. Other common hotspots were found to relate to the use of germanium as a substrate as well as the launch event. As an additional observation, in terms of the behavioural aspects, it was clear that study participants were more open to the concept of LCE with each new concurrent engineering session, evidenced by increasing levels of interaction amongst study participants. These findings are intended to provide industrial stakeholders with a preliminary benchmark relating to the general sustainability footprint of SmallSats, whilst demonstrating the viability of integrating LCE within the concurrent engineering process of space missions.},

   abstract = {Long-term space sustainability demands effective management and limitation of the growing orbital debris population. Achieving this requires first an improved quantification of environmental risk before proper mitigation can be formulated. A significant contributor to this risk is the creation of debris that is large enough to cause damage to another spacecraft upon impact, small enough to be difficult to track, and prohibitively expensive to remove due to quantity and orbital distribution. Currently, the most effective way to reduce the long-term risk of orbital debris is to prevent its generation in the first place. In line with this, the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requires, as part of their license application processes, compliance with regulations designed to limit the likelihood of events which would generate debris, such as the limitation of the probability of collision with large objects [1]. In this instance, a “large object” is any object exceeding 10 cm in diameter, and the legacy maximum allowable probability of collision is 1.0e-3 per satellite, assessed over its lifetime. To show compliance with this regulation, satellite operators commonly use NASA's Debris Assessment Software (DAS) tool. Historically, DAS has provided adequate means for assessing lifetime collision risk for single-satellite missions operating in low earth orbit (LEO). However, given the rapid increase in the number of spacecraft and large constellations that are being launched into orbit, it is prudent to re-evaluate both the regulation requirement itself, as well as the method by which compliance is determined. This paper explores the origin and intent of the requirement and assesses its efficacy through multiple case studies representing different spacecraft in various orbits. In each case study, the likelihood and impact dimensions of catastrophic fragmentation risk are computed for each spacecraft and then compared to corresponding DAS outputs. Analysis results show that not only does the likelihood of catastrophic fragmentation consistently exceed predictions by DAS, but the environmental impact may also be greatly underestimated for spacecraft more massive than 50 kg.},

We use considerations that Goodrich et al. had voiced in Business Horizons in 1987 with their piece “Business in Space: The New Frontier” to pick up on earlier thinking around venturing into space, update highlighted themes, and go beyond those. Our article follows the structure set out in 1987 and covers the current state of space commercialization, obstacles to space commercialization, opportunities in space, marketing and managerial implications, and concludes with research avenues. We find that entrepreneurship in space is currently in a phase overcoming many of the previously voiced obstacles, embracing the opportunities that space offers beyond catering to government agencies as main clients. We call this contemporary period for space Transition Space, which is situated between Old government-driven and venture-driven New Space. We argue that space is a critical new context not only for entrepreneurial activity but for entrepreneurship research as well. Our article contributes to the nascent space management literature.},

The strong co-movement is significant for most of US and European companies. Specifically, the GPR index leads the return and volatility of several US and European companies at medium and longer scales throughout the war period, and its impact is mostly positive.

Over the past decade, the number of spacefaring nations has increased, as evidenced by the number of satellites launched by emerging space nations and by an increase in the number of applications for United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UN COPUOS) membership from emerging member states. More recently, there has been an increase in emerging space nations stating their commitment to join the COPUOS Long-term Sustainability (LTS) 2.0 Working Group, as well as nations who have opted to join as signatories to initiatives such as “Net Zero Space” (e.g., Azercosmos, EgSA, GISTDA), and the Artemis Accords (e.g., Nigeria, Rwanda, and Angola). These initiatives share a common goal of promoting the sustainable and responsible use of space to ensure the long-term sustainability of space activities, including: 1) the recognition of the need for sustainable practices; 2) the importance of promoting cooperation in long-term sustainability between all nations; 3) the support of international guidelines and best practices; and 4) the recognition of the increasing role and contribution of emerging space nations. Given the rapid diversification of the space sector, and in accordance with Part C International Cooperation, Capacity-Building and Awareness of the 2019 COPUOS Long Term Sustainability guidelines, many emerging nations continue to face challenges in implementing space debris mitigation and removal measures. The aim of this paper is threefold: 1) showcase examples of emerging space nations who are actively supporting the sustained use of space at a national, regional, and international level, which includes complying with existing binding requirements concerning space debris within national laws; 2) discuss how the Space Sustainability Rating (SSR) provides opportunities for emerging space nations to progress in their efforts to participate in seeking space sustainability; and 3) provide an analysis using the SSR for several missions launched by emerging space nations including recommended steps for increased sustainability in both the design phase and during operations. The study aims to identify potential challenges and opportunities in the adoption of the SSR by emerging space nations, and dispel the perception that sustainable design, operations, and implementation of the LTS guidelines is a barrier for emerging space nations. The selection of nations chosen for the analysis of this paper aims to ensure a representative sample of diverse space market sizes and maturity, with particular consideration given to geographic diversity.},

The actors in these missions are commercial and institutional, public and private. The bandwidth of planned missions is wide, ranging from scientific exploration to commercial exploitation. In-situ resource utilization is planned to support such missions and thus reduce the amount of effort needed for transportation of goods to mission regions, e.g. by supplying water or fuel on the lunar or Martian surface. In the past decades the concept of sustainable development and sustainability has been evolved and became more and more relevant for many aspects of human life and society. These terms have also migrated into more specialized fields such as spaceflight. This paper systematically reviews the concepts of sustainable development and sustainability which have been formulated in a spaceflight context implicitly and explicitly. For this purpose, four perspectives are defined which originate from either Earth or space and alternate with the addressed object between Earth and space as well. It is explained and discussed how these concepts manifest in a spaceflight context, how they evolved over time and which implications result from the respective point of view. Subsequently, the formulation of space in-situ sustainable development is coined and an outlook is given how to further evolve this centric idea to enable a comprehensive evaluation of mission scenarios and roadmaps with regard to their sustainability.},

The purpose of this article was to describe the discussions held at the First Sustainable Space Economy Workshop held in Finland 2019. The workshop gathered together experts with economic, legal, regulatory, technological, and environmental backgrounds, with an aim of discussing the sustainable use of space from all these perspectives. As an outcome of these discussions, we find that two concepts, satellite sustainability footprint and orbital capacity, should be introduced at an international level. The satellite sustainability footprint measures how likely the satellite stays healthy and operating, without causing risks to self or others. The orbit capacity is essentially an integral of the footprint over an orbit, and it determines how many satellites of different footprints could be launched to the same orbit. In addition, in this article, we discuss how to realize such concepts within the current normative framework. The authors suggest both top-down and bottom-up approaches, necessitating negotiations within an intergovernmental framework and with the relevant space actors. The most important finding of the workshop and this article, however, is that different space-related fields and experts having diverse backgrounds should continuously discuss in a constructive and informal manner to realize the sustainable utilization of space in practice.},

The present study aimed at testing a method for the identification and categorization of space waste to facilitate the definition of effective sorting and recycling operations in space. In more detail, the study investigated the potential of a sustainable, low-cost method based on hyperspectral imaging (HSI), employing HSI sensors operating in two spectral ranges—shortwave infrared (SWIR) and near-infrared (NIR)—to develop a classification model capable of identifying and sorting space waste for recycling. The findings demonstrate the advantages of using HSI techniques to identify, recognize, and classify various materials, thereby presenting a viable approach aligned with the circular model. Moreover, the proposed approach is non-invasive and non-destructive, eliminating the need for chemicals that could harm the environment. The technique may enable the differentiation of potentially valuable space waste from pollutants, contributing to sustainable waste management and the circular economy.},

To improve upon some of the inherent limitations of ground radars, a constellation of satellites carrying optical sensors for the surveillance of the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) region is analysed. This analysis aims to understand the performance drivers of such a system in terms of constellation geometry and provide a general methodology for the preliminary design of the system. First, a method for decoupling the design of the optical payload and the constellation geometry while retaining statistically significant results is shown. Using the resulting estimate for the maximum observable distance, an approximate method for computing the coverage of the system is proposed. The expected daily and yearly variation of coverage depending on its own dynamics and the position of the Sun is analysed, showing that it has a small impact on the design process. The dependence of the coverage on constellation parameters such as altitude, inclination and distribution of satellites is investigated through parametric analysis, retrieving an estimate for the Pareto front of the system. Building upon the previous results, a random search method is shown to be effective in finding a design point lying on the Pareto front that is robust to both random satellite loss and deployment strategy. Finally, a reduced budget architecture is proposed to achieve acceptable performance while using only a few tens of satellites. The resulting work answers the problems of estimating and optimising the performance of a distributed system for space-based surveillance of the LEO region, a stepping stone for future cost–benefit analyses for the enhancement of space surveillance networks.},

Several techniques for ADR are technically plausible enough to merit further research and eventually operational testing. However, all ADR technologies present significant legal and policy challenges which will need to be addressed for debris removal to become viable. This paper summarizes the most promising techniques for removing space debris in both LEO and GEO, including electrodynamic tethers and ground- and space-based lasers. It then discusses several of the legal and policy challenges posed, including: lack of separate legal definitions for functional operational spacecraft and non-functional space debris; lack of international consensus on which types of space debris objects should be removed; sovereignty issues related to who is legally authorized to remove pieces of space debris; the need for transparency and confidence-building measures to reduce misperceptions of ADR as anti-satellite weapons; and intellectual property rights and liability with regard to ADR operations. Significant work on these issues must take place in parallel to the technical research and development of ADR techniques, and debris removal needs to be done in an environment of international collaboration and cooperation. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

The increasing number of countries with space programs, advancing commercialization, and ambitious satellite constellation projects raise concerns about space debris and the increase of mass flux into the atmosphere due to deorbiting of satellites and rocket bodies. A comparison of this anthropogenic influx to the natural influx due to meteoroids is presented giving detailed information about the mass, composition and ablation of the entering matter. Currently, anthropogenic material does make up about 2.8% compared to the annual injected mass of natural origin. For two different future scenarios considering planned and already partially installed large satellite constellations this fraction increases to nearly 13%, respectively 40%. For these cases, the anthropogenic injection of several metals prevails the injection by natural sources by far. Considering different ablation products, we find that the anthropogenic injection of aerosols into the atmosphere increases disproportionately. Today, they make up about 1% compared to the injected aerosol mass of natural origin, increasing to 30% and 94% for the two future scenarios, respectively. Considering the injection of atoms, the natural injection is dominant by far. For the two future scenarios, the anthropogenic injection is only at 5%, respectively 15% compared to the annual natural atom injection. The predicted strong increase in anthropogenic injection will make it significant in comparison to the natural injection which can have yet unknown effects on Earth's atmosphere and the terrestrial habitat.},

   abstract = {As actors in the space sector are proposing ever more ambitious plans for the future, it is important to evaluate their consequences on the Earth's environment, which are yet poorly known. To address this gap, this study presents a streamlined Life Cycle Assessment of future space activities over the period from 2022 to 2050 based on plans that would likely drive the environmental impacts of the space sector if they were realised. Large constellations of satellites, space tourism, Moon missions, and space-based solar power were considered in a first scenario, while rocket-based point-to-point travel on Earth and Mars colonisation were also included in two other scenarios. To this aim, the model is based on data from companies' declarations and actual space systems and uses life cycle inventory and impact assessment data from the Strathclyde Space Systems Database. In the first scenario, the study finds that by 2050 proposed plans would lead to an unprecedented surge in the impacts of the space sector (×9 on climate change) and in the number of satellites in orbit (∼112,000, all from large constellations). Ozone depletion from launch events could reach significant levels (6% of annual global impacts), while in a decade emissions of black carbon and aluminium oxide from rockets may alter the radiative balance of the atmosphere as much as present-day global aviation, although these effects are uncertain and poorly understood yet. Moreover, the mass injected into the atmosphere by re-entering artificial objects would become significant (∼27× the natural level for aluminium), while its environmental consequences remain largely unquantified. In the two other scenarios, results indicate that speculative plans of rocket-based point-to-point travel on Earth and Mars colonisation could deplete ozone several times as much as all other human activities combined, while air acidification and climate change could reach several percent of annual global impacts and planetary boundaries. The mitigation of these impacts using low carbon fuels would be limited by supply availability and by the emission of non-CO2 climate forcers and ozone-destroying compounds during launch and re-entry. Consequently, environmental sustainability is identified as a potential limiting factor to the development of intense space activities and to making humanity a multi-planetary species. Furthermore, political and social acceptability could play a major role in the development of recreational space travel since it exacerbates environmental inequalities due to an unparalleled combination of economic inaccessibility and high environmental footprints per passenger. Overall, results strongly suggest that there is a pressing need to include environmental considerations in addition to technical and economic analyses in space projects definition and space systems design.},

Today, space debris is today a significant and constant danger to all space missions. Consequently, it becomes compelled to design new space missions considering End-of-Life requirements in order to ensure the sustainable use of space orbits. Furthermore, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has been identified by the European Space Agency as an adequate tool to measure the environmental impact of spacecraft missions. Hence, our challenge is to integrate orbital space use into Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) to broaden the scope of LCA for space systems. The generation of debris in the near-Earth's orbital regions leads to a decrease in volume availability. The Area-of-Protection (AoP) ‘resources’ seems to be the most relevant reflection of this depletion. To address orbital space use in a comprehensive way, we propose a first attempt at establishing an impact pathway linking outer space use to resources. This framework will be the basis for defining new indicator(s) related to orbital space use.},

First, the paper will present the latest updates to the debris index used as a metric of the environment capacity, including the inclusion of a penalisation for objects with low trackability and an improved model for the break-up probability. Then, several application cases will be discussed to demonstrate its use as design driver. First, the relevance of adopting operational best practices (i.e. collision avoidance and disposal manoeuvres) will be studied for different spacecraft classes as a way of quantifying better than required behaviour. Then, the environmental impact of a mission will be analysed considering the case when the mission is realised through a single large satellite or through a constellation of smaller satellites. Finally, different end-of-life scenarios will be assessed to demonstrate the use of the method to discriminate between various technologies on a case-by-case basis. The adoption of passive de-orbiting systems will be compared to conventional disposal through de-orbit burns or operations at lower altitudes to gain insight into how two different options, both compliant to existing guidelines, differ in terms of the resulting environmental impact. Finally, a scenario with active-debris-removal will be considered, showing how the quantification of the impact on the debris environment can support the selection of parameters such as the rendez-vous altitude, based on the expected success rate of the capture and final disposal phase.},

   abstract = {The space industry generates pressures on the environment and strives towards more sustainable activities. Several actors of or related to the European space industry, such as ArianeGroup or and the European Space Agency (ESA), have identified the life cycle assessment methodology (LCA) as the most appropriate methodology to measure and then support the reduction of their environmental impact. While the use of the LCA is being established within the sector, only a limited number of peer-reviewed publications are available. Most of the documents released by the stakeholders can be considered to be grey literature. As the topic has not been properly discussed in the literature, there is an opportunity to bring the initiatives carried out by the space sector in recent years to the public domain. Thus, the present work aims to provide a comprehensive overview of past and present studies following the LCA framework. The review compiles 11 papers, conferences proceedings or technical reports that address the development of the LCA framework and good practices in the sector and 27 documents dedicated to LCA studies. On the one hand, the results highlight the emergence of a common framework regarding LCA practice in Europe. On the other hand, the analysed LCA case studies show a highly heterogeneous goal and scope definition. In this review, research needs and methodological challenges are identified and discussed. Finally, recommendations on how to implement and develop the use of LCA within the space industry are given in view of designing more sustainable space systems and associated missions.},

Large-scale solar arrays are typically located near arable land. However, limited data on the toxicity of perovskite compounds are currently available. This study investigated the effect of potentially hazardous chemicals from Pb-based perovskite solar cells on two crop plants (mungbean and sorghum). The direct exposure of a single chemical (PbI2) in soil media was simulated, a plant soil assay was conducted, and phytotoxicity was subsequently evaluated. After 21 days of exposure, toxicity symptoms in plant growth and physiological responses were observed. The results show that plant root and shoot growth and photosynthetic capacity all remarkably decreased by chemical exposure. Both Pb and I were found to be associated with toxicity symptoms. The reactions of these crop plants to PbI2 exposure indicate the potential phytotoxicity of leachable compounds from Pb-based perovskite solar cells; further, the results obtained in this study will contribute to the assessment of risks associated with the use of these cells in large-scale commercial solar arrays.},

The theoretical framework of the research included concepts from Industry 4.0, sustainability, circular supply chains and emerging technologies, underpinning the analysis of the integration of these elements. The research was conducted through a systematic literature review, analysing 28 articles published between 2017 and 2024 that discussed the integration of Industry 4.0 technologies into circular supply chains. The results indicate that the integration of Industry 4.0 technologies predominantly occurs through the paradox of economic growth, efficiency, and technological innovation. This integration aids in promoting circular practices by identifying waste, opportunities for material reuse, tracking waste and by-products and predicting product demand with greater accuracy, among other benefits. The conclusion of the research highlights the importance of sustainability, innovation and interdisciplinary collaboration in driving more efficient and sustainable practices within supply chains. The contributions include the expansion of knowledge on the integration of Industry 4.0 technologies into circular supply chains, the identification of opportunities for future research, the encouragement of interdisciplinarity and collaboration, and the promotion of more efficient and sustainable practices across various sectors of the economy.},

The survey aims to establish whether the promotional activities of ESA, NASA and other space agencies are aligned with the perceived benefits of this sample population. Is space contributing to what the target people consider important? What could be done to improve/change this perception? How did the public perception evolve? Which are the biggest problems humanity is confronted with today according to the sample population? Could space help addressing these major problems? The paper will firstly present the statistical analysis of the sample answers and the conclusions that can be drawn from them.

Carbon taxes are an energy policy tool for substantially carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions reduction. This paper proposes a new strategy to promote the use of renewable energy by enterprises in industrial parks against the backdrop of a carbon tax. Using an evolutionary game model based on life cycle assessment (LCA), this study investigates the impact of dynamic carbon tax mechanisms, fines, and subsidies on the energy choices of industrial park enterprises. This paper's primary contribution is the incorporation of LCA into the evolutionary game model, which facilitates accurate calculation of the carbon tax parameter value. According to the study's findings, the carbon tax rate increases the propensity of enterprises to acquire a high percentage of renewable energy. While there is a negative relationship between fines and the propensity of enterprises to adopt a low proportion of renewable energy, an increase in subsidies decreases the proportion of enterprises that purchase a high proportion of renewable energy. This paper concludes by providing a theoretical foundation for policymakers to construct precise carbon tax schemes and promote renewable energy consumption among industrial park enterprises while simultaneously reducing carbon emissions.},

   abstract = {Space activities are now expanding at a fast pace and various ambitious projects have been proposed for the future, raising the question of their environmental sustainability. While the space debris situation has been widely recognized as a serious threat to space sustainability, other pressing environmental issues have received little attention yet, although they pose risks to the environment and actors of the space sector. Therefore, this paper first reviews the major environmental impacts of space activities and their potential growth, analyzed together in a comprehensive approach for the first time. The degradation of the orbital environment with space debris has already reached a threshold leading to a future increase of the number of objects even without additional launches, while the contribution of artificial space objects to night sky brightness may have already crossed the light pollution threshold defined by astronomers. Planned large constellations will likely deteriorate the situation significantly. In this context, the formulation of these thresholds within the planetary boundaries framework is proposed to support awareness-raising and policy-making. Furthermore, stratospheric ozone depletion and climate change resulting from rocket emissions could reach levels triggering regulatory responses in the next decades due to the coming surge in launch rates. This could also apply to particles from thousands of constellations' satellites burning while reentering Earth's atmosphere, although the magnitude of their effects is yet unknown. A common assumption is that limitations to the human enterprise in space are of a purely technical and economic nature. This paper challenges this assumption, by highlighting the existence of environmental limits to the currently planned development of space activities. Risks arising from these limits are explored, and the importance of ecodesign in the space sector is emphasized. Finally, the paper discusses the future sustainability of proposed space projects in the context of global ecological transition.},

It is within this region, and especially in low Earth orbit, where environmental issues are becoming urgent because of the rapid growth of the anthropogenic space object population, including satellite ‘mega-constellations’. In this Perspective, we summarize the case for considering the orbital space around the Earth as an additional ecosystem, subject to the same care and concerns, and the same broad regulations as the oceans and the atmosphere, for example. We rely on the orbital space environment by looking through it, as well as by working within it. Hence, we should consider damage to professional astronomy, public stargazing, and the cultural importance of the sky, as well as the sustainability of commercial, civic, and military activity in space. Damage to the orbital space environment has problematic features in common with other types of environmental issue. First, the observed and predicted damage is incremental and complex, with many contributors. Second, whether or not space is formally and legally seen as a global commons, the growing commercial exploitation of what may seem to be a ‘free’ resource is in fact externalizing the true costs.},

They are socially constructed and this article identifies four: the high seas and deep seabed, Antarctica, outer space and the global atmosphere although attempts to designate new areas as commons are also noted. The construction of global commons, it is argued, has been determined by shifts in human knowledge, capability and perceptions of scarcity. The commons problem, as defined by Hardin and other analysts arises from the ecological consequences of open access, but also from the renewed concerns of strategists about the military use of common spaces. In the international system a primary response has been to extend sovereignty and the degree to which the global commons have been enclosed is assessed. An alternative model is provided by the negotiation of common heritage status, but since the experiment with the deep sea bed this has not found favour in the Arctic, Antarctic and elsewhere. In terms of the continuing management of the commons the international community has resorted to an array of regulatory regimes of varying coverage and effectiveness. © 2012 London School of Economics and Political Science and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

I call global commons law an ‘uncommon’ realm within international law that is composed of principles and practices that dovetail with treaties aimed at protecting humankind. These laws have an atypical purpose and are characterized by a commonality of interests based on the view that safeguarding these domains is in the interests of developing and developed countries alike, with scientists, activists, and international institutions jointly having a convening power to maintain peace. To elaborate on the impact and implications of the global commons law, I explain three of its functions: guardianship of future generations; creation of a comity for peace and peaceful settlement of disputes; and setting norms as the foundation for peaceful relations. These norms in turn have four key objectives: they provide common ground for peace and cooperation; ensure equity between rich and poor countries; create a forum for equitable burden-sharing; and prevent future harm. The Global Commons face threats – melting ice caps, greenhouse gases, and overfishing – that imperil the survival of humanity.

   abstract = {The recent growth of the space sector, spurred by a surge in private actors, has led to a sharp increase in our ability to address societal challenges through space data. However, this has exacerbated an already critical situation in space: the proliferation of space debris and a critical expansion of space traffic which is leading to high levels of orbital congestion. In parallel, increased levels of spacecraft production and orbital launches are also heightening the environmental footprint of the sector. This might lead to a paradoxical situation whereby the use of space to support the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) becomes unsustainable from the perspective of both the Earth and space environment. This situation can be described as the ‘space sustainability paradox’. This paper presents this concept for the first time and argues that existing policies and remediation actions are not a long-term sustainable solution for tackling this issue and may actually intensify the problem. This places an added importance upon addressing space sustainability in a more coherent, strategic and responsible manner, potentially based on the doughnut economic model of social and planetary boundaries. Doing so may prevent the sector from falling victim to a ‘tragedy of the commons’ type of scenario and avoid negative trends from becoming the norm. As a result, this would ensure that outer space can continue to be used by future generations to address societal challenges, without priming severe and enduring damage to the Earth and space environment.},

   abstract = {In recent years, the Mars One program has gained significant publicity for its plans to colonize the red planet. Beginning in 2025, the program plans to land four people on Mars every 26 months via a series of one-way missions, using exclusively existing technology. This one-way approach has frequently been cited as a key enabler of accelerating the first crewed landing on Mars. While the Mars One program has received considerable attention, little has been published in the technical literature regarding the formulation of its mission architecture. In light of this, we perform an independent analysis of the technical feasibility of the Mars One mission plan, focusing on the architecture of the life support and in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) systems, and their impact on sparing and space logistics. To perform this analysis, we adopt an iterative analysis approach in which we model and simulate the mission architecture, assess its feasibility, implement any applicable modifications while attempting to remain within the constraints set forth by Mars One, and then resimulate and reanalyze the revised version of the mission architecture. Where required information regarding the Mars One mission architecture is not available, we assume numerical values derived from standard spaceflight design handbooks and documents. Through four iterations of this process, our analysis finds that the Mars One mission plan, as publicly described, is not feasible. This conclusion is obtained from analyses based on mission assumptions derived from and constrained by statements made by Mars One, and is the result of the following findings: (1) several technologies including ISRU, life support, and entry, descent, and landing (EDL) are not currently "existing, validated and available" as claimed by Mars One; (2) the crop growth area described by Mars One is insufficient to feed their crew; (3) increasing the crop growth area to provide sufficient food for the crew leads to atmospheric imbalances that requires a prohibitively large ISRU atmospheric processor or a notably different system architecture to manage; and (4) at least 13 Falcon Heavy launches are needed to deliver a portion of the required equipment to the Martian surface, a value that is at least double that planned by Mars One for the same mission phase. Most importantly, we find that the one-way nature of the Mars One mission, coupled with its plans to increase its crew population every 26 months, causes the operating costs of the program to grow continually over time. This is due to the fact that maintaining a growing colony on the Martian surface incurs increasing equipment and spare parts resupply requirements and hence launch costs over time. Based on published launch vehicle and lander estimates, our analysis finds that by the launch of the fifth crew, the cost associated with launching a portion of all required equipment and spares is approximately equal to half of the total NASA FY2015 budget - and this cost will grow when other critical systems outside the scope of this analysis are included. To mitigate these costs and bring the plan closer towards feasibility, we recommend a number of mission architecture modifications and technology development efforts be implemented before the initiation of any Mars settlement campaign. These include the further development of EDL, life support, and ISRU technologies, as well as additive manufacturing technology that utilizes ISRU-derived Martian feedstock as a potential means to address the growing cost of resupply.},

However, existing studies on the economic viability of asteroid mining do not provide much guidance on which technological improvements would be needed for increasing its economic viability. This paper develops a techno-economic analysis of asteroid mining with the objective of providing basic recommendations for future technology development and performance improvements. Both, providing water in space as well as returning platinum to Earth are considered. Starting from first principles of techno-economic analysis, gradually additional economic and technological factors are added to the analysis model. Applied to mining missions involving spacecraft reuse, learning curve effect, and multiple spacecraft, their economic viability is assessed. A sensitivity analysis with respect to throughput rate, spacecraft mass, and resource price is performed. Furthermore, a sample asteroid mining architecture for volatiles based on small CubeSat-class spacecraft is presented. It is concluded that key technological drivers for asteroid mining missions are throughput rate, number of spacecraft per mission, and the rate in which successive missions are conducted. Furthermore, for returning platinum to Earth, market reaction strongly influences its economic viability and it seems to be economically viable only under unlikely conditions.},

Yet there is an increasing awareness of the need for space sustainability within the space community and this should be focused towards shaping policy in respect of lunar exploration.

Disputes over legally binding methods of lunar resource allocation are harming the chances of obtaining any consensus regarding sustainable development. This discussion will show that there is no compelling evidence that commercial mining of the Moon will yield the vast natural resources that would make such a venture economically viable. It will be advocated that a policy of promoting the use of the moon for scientific and exploratory purposes by means of existing fora such as IDAC and using non-binding codes to create normative values of sustainability should be placed at the heart of lunar exploration policy.},

   abstract = {As humanity prepares to extend its reach beyond low-Earth-orbit for the first time since the 1970s, a new symbol of international cooperation is needed to further promote the message of peace and collaboration such exploration entails. The space race that occurred between the USSR and the USA is an ill-suited model for long-term sustained space exploration because it is too costly and too resource-intensive for a single nation to bear. While competition is healthy for technology development, the success of a sustained space exploration strategy lies beyond technological capabilities. It lies in international cooperation, space policy, and public support. Without these, no program can realistically achieve a sustained presence in space beyond low-Earth orbit. To this effect, this paper proposes a cost-effective first step in the form of a universal symbol which, when placed alongside national flags displayed on hardware and astronaut/cosmonaut/taikonaut flight-suits, would send a strong message to the world that space exploration is done for the benefit of humanity as a whole, not just for spacefaring nations. The " Blue Marble" , the first complete picture of Earth taken from space by humans in 1972, fits this universally appealing symbol. This symbol requires no political collaboration between countries, yet is an image that anyone, anywhere in the world, can relate to regardless of nationality, ethnic origin or religious beliefs. Placed on the shoulder pads of human 'nauts - ambassadors of planet Earth - or prominently displayed on spacebound hardware, this symbol would send a universal message to present and future generations that, in space, our planet is working together for the benefit of everyone. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

While new cooperative mechanisms have emerged in recent decades, the now-unfolding era of global space exploration will lead to new models of cooperation, reflecting the legacy of partnerships and the evolution of a global endeavor. Consequently, the successful alignment of national and international stakeholders along lines drawn by commonality of purpose will be crucial to achieve a basis for marshalling sufficient resources for ambitious space projects, and to create necessary new political, economic, and legal frameworks. For the development of a successful global space exploration program, traditional approaches may need to be supplanted by a new paradigm including focus on information exchange, organizational knowledge, and human capital - as practiced in high-performance organizations (HPOs) - that go well beyond the current international working groups and multinational space efforts. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Interest in orbital debris risk has been on the rise in recent years, as small satellites are launched in accelerating numbers, proposals for large low-Earth orbit (LEO) constellations mature, and the orbital debris population continues to grow. Environmental models are being exercised to predict collisional risk, private equity is now supporting the development of commercial Space Situational Awareness (SSA) and Active Debris Removal (ADR) services, and debris mitigation best practices and licensing guidelines are being updated by industry groups and national administrations. These are all positive responses to an increasingly challenging space operational environment, but as is often the case, we tend to rush to solutions before adequately defining the problem we are trying to solve. The authors propose Space Safety as a simple objective statement for an industry operating in a debris-laden space environment and establish the lethal nontrackable (LNT) debris population as the primary risk to assured operations in space. The authors then make the case that SAA and Space Traffic Management (STM) alone are insufficient responses to collision risk and propose Space Environment Management (SEM), consisting of both debris mitigation and debris remediation, as a critical component of a comprehensive framework the space community can use to assess the efficacy of its efforts and to prioritize the appropriation of its resources. The paper concludes with recommendations for setting priorities and directing the community's efforts and resources.},

Other impacts of human space exploration that may be detrimental to space exploration itself are not covered. The best known example is the anthropogenic space debris orbiting Earth, but similar problems will occur in other places due to scientific and commercial space exploration in the near future. One possible approach to discuss and mitigate the impact of space exploration on the environment is to consider the space environment as integral part of sustainable development. The resulting concept of “planetary sustainability” and its ethical, scientific, economic, and legal ramifications were discussed during a workshop co-sponsored by the International Space Science Institute in March 2018. In this paper, we first summarize the results of this workshop. Then we propose potential implications of this concept for space research and report reactions and suggestions by members of the space research community during the COSPAR assembly 2018.},

   abstract = {The Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis postulates an inverted-U-shaped relationship between different pollutants and per capita income, i.e., environmental pressure increases up to a certain level as income goes up; after that, it decreases. An EKC actually reveals how a technically specified measurement of environmental quality changes as the fortunes of a country change. A sizeable literature on EKC has grown in recent period. The common point of all the studies is the assertion that the environmental quality deteriorates at the early stages of economic development/growth and subsequently improves at the later stages. In other words, environmental pressure increases faster than income at early stages of development and slows down relative to GDP growth at higher income levels. This paper reviews some theoretical developments and empirical studies dealing with EKC phenomenon. Possible explanations for this EKC are seen in (i) the progress of economic development, from clean agrarian economy to polluting industrial economy to clean service economy; (ii) tendency of people with higher income having higher preference for environmental quality, etc. Evidence of the existence of the EKC has been questioned from several corners. Only some air quality indicators, especially local pollutants, show the evidence of an EKC. However, an EKC is empirically observed, till there is no agreement in the literature on the income level at which environmental degradation starts declining. This paper provides an overview of the EKC literature, background history, conceptual insights, policy and the conceptual and methodological critique. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

These policy coordination steps achieved during the height of the Cold War can be regarded as pioneering steps towards ensuring the long-term sustainability of the space domain. Yet threats to the continued safe, secure and sustainable use of outer space have been dramatically increasing over the past decade calling for an evaluation of the existing governance mechanisms. This paper presents the intermediate results of a doctoral research on the emergence and progress of space debris governance mechanisms, the orbital debris issue being considered one of the major threats to space sustainability. An innovative international relations' framework is used drawing upon two studies, namely Peter Haas' [1] seminal work on epistemic communities' influences over international policy coordination and Thomas Weiss and Ramesh Thakur's work [2] on the United Nation's contribution to global governance gaps. The doctoral research findings highlight the essential role of ‘epistemic" knowledge experts in the emergence and evolution of cooperative steps affecting the debris issue, regarded more widely as illustrations of contributions of the epistemic model to space sustainability governance. The study's timeframe covers governance progress from the 1950s until nowadays. This research also identifies levels of governance progress achieved thanks to epistemic influences and provides avenues of thoughts for overcoming obstacles in international cooperation when national security interests are at stake.},

   abstract = {It seems to be an accepted assumption that human migration into space is inevitable. However, almost 60 years of scientific studies of the effects of space on Earth life suggest this is not a given. Life on Earth evolved in the context of conditions that are unique to Earth and are not duplicated anywhere else in our solar system. The science indicates that life-sustaining conditions on Earth could be the very things that inhibit our ability to live off-Earth. This paper combines 100 years of scientific development of a theory of ecological thermodynamics with classical mechanics theory and analytical models of self-restoring heat engines to explain how the Sun and Earth have evolved into islands of order in the entropy of space. An explanation is provided regarding how naturally occurring conservative force fields engage a diversity of natural resources in semi-reversible cycles that build a high-exergy ecosphere. The science infers that the ability to establish a human settlement in space without Earth-like self-restoring order, capacity, and organization will result in settlement sustainment challenges. Historical evidence of Earth settlements with disrupted ecosystems point to the following possibilities. Supply chains would disappear, market resources would be depleted, advancement in human pursuits would be disrupted, social and governance systems would falter or collapse, human population numbers would decline, genetic diversity in the human genome would be lost, average human individual biomass would decrease, and human knowledge and understanding would be forgotten. What does it mean to have a location in space outside of Earth be “like Earth?” The results of research are presented as a pancosmorio theory of human sustainability that is developed using the scientific philosophy methodology of abductive reasoning. Four analytical models of space ecosphere sustainability and five hypotheses with proposed tests for falsifiability are provided, including a theorem that suggests a limit to human expansion into space. A new quantitative method of human sustainability is developed from theories of network ecology, providing orthogonal properties of an ecosystem network stability function based upon an ecosystem network production function. Conclusions are made regarding the potential for sustainable development in space using balanced sustainability.

Risks associated with space missions include technical, human, launch, space environment, mission design, budgetary, and political risks. Sustainability considerations must be incorporated into mission planning and execution to ensure the long-term viability of space exploration. The study emphasizes the importance of considering environmental sustainability, resource use, ethical concerns, long-term planning, international collaboration, and public outreach in space missions. It emphasizes the significance of reducing negative environmental consequences, increasing resource use efficiency, and making responsible and ethical actions. The paper offers a multi-objective optimization conceptual model that may be used to evaluate and choose sustainable space mission tactics. This approach considers a variety of elements, including environmental effects, resource utilization, mission cost, and advantages for society. It provides a systematic decision-making approach that examines trade-offs between different criteria and identifies optimal conceptual model solutions that balance risk, sustainability, and supply chain objectives. A practical approach is also offered to demonstrate the use of the multi-criteria optimization conceptual model in a space mission scenario. The practical approach demonstrates how the model can aid in the development of mission strategies that minimize risks, maximize resource consumption, and fit with sustainability goals.

   abstract = {After decades where human spaceflight missions have been reserved to low Earth orbit, recent years have seen mission proposals and even implemented plans, e.g. with the mission Artemis I, for returning to the lunar surface. SpaceX has published over various media (e.g., its official website, conference presentations, user manual) conceptual information for its reusable Starship to enable human exploration missions to the Martian surface by the end of the decade. The technological and human challenges associated with these plans are daunting. Such a mission at that distance would require excellent system reliability and in-situ-resource utilization on a grand scale, e.g. to produce propellant. The plans contain little details however and have not yet been reviewed concerning their feasibility. In this paper we show significant technological gaps in these plans. Based on estimates and extrapolated data, a mass model as needed to fulfill SpaceX’s plans could not be reproduced and the subsequent trajectory optimization showed that the current plans do not yield a return flight opportunity, due to a too large system mass. Furthermore, significant gaps exist in relevant technologies, e.g. power supply for the Martian surface. It is unlikely that these gaps can be closed until the end of the decade. We recommend several remedies, e.g. stronger international participation to distribute technology development and thus improve feasibility. Overall, with the limited information published by SpaceX about its system and mission scenario and extrapolation from us to fill information gaps, we were not able to find a feasible Mars mission scenario using Starship, even when assuming optimal conditions such as 100% recovery rate of crew consumables during flight.},

   abstract = {Background: On a future lunar habitat, acquiring needed resources in situ will inevitably come from the Lunar regolith. Biomining, i.e. the use of microorganisms to extract metals from the regolith, is sustainable and energy-efficient, making it highly promising for space exploration applications. Given the extensive use of filamentous fungi in industrial biotechnology, we investigated the ability of the fungus Penicillium simplicissimum to extract metals from the European Astronaut Centre lunar regolith simulant 1 (EAC-1 A), which will be used as the analogue soil at the European Lunar Exploration Laboratory (LUNA) facility at the European Space Agency (ESA) and German Aerospace Centre (DLR) site. Results: Biocompatibility tests demonstrated P. simplicissimum tolerance to high concentrations of EAC-1 A lunar regolith simulant (up to 60%), both on Earth gravity and Lunar simulated gravity via clinorotation. We reveal that a fungal bioleaching setup using low nutrient medium (20% PDB) enables P. simplicissimum to extract metals from EAC-1 A regolith over the course of 2 weeks at room temperature. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis of the leachate revealed the extraction of magnesium (up to 159 mg/L), calcium (151 mg/L), iron (68 mg/L), aluminium (32 mg/L), manganese (3 mg/L) as well as traces of titanium (0.02 mg/L). The recovered metal oxide powder from the leachate, obtained via centrifugation (14,500 g, 4,000 rpm), followed by filtration (0.22 μm) and drying at 60 °C overnight, achieved a promising average of 10 ± 3 g/L. Further analysis via SEM/EDS and XRD confirmed the presence of aluminium [as boehmite (AlO(OH))], magnesium, and iron [possibly as haematite (Fe2O3)] and magnetite [possibly as (Fe3O4)]. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates successful fungal biomining of lunar regolith simulant EAC-1 A and emphasizes the utilization of fungal-based approaches as promising ISRU technologies in future space exploration missions.},

This study reviews the efficiency of electrolysis technologies, oxygen applications, and their environmental and economic impacts. Proton exchange membrane (PEM)-based systems show up to 85 % efficiencies, while transition metal catalysts increase efficiencies to 90 %. Integrating solar photovoltaic systems with electrolysis yields 80 % efficiency despite the challenges of power fluctuations. High-purity oxygen from electrolysis has broad applications, including respiratory therapy in the medical field, aeration in wastewater treatment, and more efficient combustion of fossil fuels in the energy sector, all contributing to reduced carbon emissions. In an industrial context, oxygen supports the efficiency of processes such as welding and chemical oxidation. The novelty of this study lies in the in-depth exploration of the economic opportunities and environmental impacts of oxygen as a by-product. The potential for increased revenue from oxygen could accelerate the adoption of green hydrogen technologies. Key challenges include the cost of oxygen storage and the need for more efficient liquid storage technologies. Further research is recommended to improve the modular design of electrolysis reactors and more stable integration with renewable energy systems. By overcoming these barriers, oxygen from water electrolysis could be a significant innovation for sustainability across sectors.},

   abstract = {Continuous missions to Low-Earth Orbit, Moon and even Mars missions are the prospect for the coming decades of especially human spaceflight. The actors in these missions are commercial and institutional, public and private. The bandwidth of planned missions is wide, ranging from scientific exploration to commercial exploitation. In-situ resource utilization is planned to support such missions and thus reduce the amount of effort needed for transportation of goods to mission regions, e.g. by supplying water or fuel on the lunar or Martian surface. In the past decades the concept of sustainable development and sustainability has been evolved and became more and more relevant for many aspects of human life and society. These terms have also migrated into more specialized fields such as spaceflight. This paper systematically reviews the concepts of sustainable development and sustainability which have been formulated in a spaceflight context implicitly and explicitly. For this purpose, four perspectives are defined which originate from either Earth or space and alternate with the addressed object between Earth and space as well. It is explained and discussed how these concepts manifest in a spaceflight context, how they evolved over time and which implications result from the respective point of view. Subsequently, the formulation of space in-situ sustainable development is coined and an outlook is given how to further evolve this centric idea to enable a comprehensive evaluation of mission scenarios and roadmaps with regard to their sustainability.},

@article{Wilson2023,
   abstract = {Within the space sector, the application of Environmental Life Cycle Assessment (E-LCA) is beginning to emerge as a credible and compelling method for scientifically quantifying environmental impacts of space missions. However, E-LCA does not fully align with the concept of triple-bottom-line sustainability, while the combination of all three sustainability dimensions (environment, society, and economy) within a single life cycle study has thus far never been attempted within the space industry. Moving toward a Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA) is, therefore, a logical next step for the space sector to allow these three sustainability dimensions to be addressed. Consequently, this article presents the underlying principles of a new LCSA framework for space missions and demonstrates its applicability for improving system-level design concepts based on the interaction between sustainability dimensions. The framework was formed based on a systematic literature review to analyze the background, issues, and knowledge gaps related to life cycle methodologies, as well as context-specific sustainability aspects. The framework has been implemented within a life cycle database called the Strathclyde Space Systems Database (SSSD). Using the SSSD, the framework was tested on a mission concept called Moon Ice Observation Satellite to demonstrate how changes in the design for a circular economy and other sustainability-based principles will affect the functionality of the mission at the system level. It is envisaged that this framework will enable engineers to create sustainable space systems, technologies, and products that are not only cost-efficient, eco-efficient, and socially responsible, but also ones that can easily justify and evidence their sustainability.

   abstract = {The current emergence of a new space economy is leading to the exploration of outer space towards unforeseen futures. Space tourism is a new addition to the tourism industry, prompted in large part by adventure-seeking individualism and potentially lucrative private business prospects. However, in light of the current megatrend of environmentalism, different space tourism activities are facing climate change-related challenges to convince the greater public of their necessity, especially as the high cost involved for suborbital space travel limits it to a niche adventure activity for the wealthy. This article explores the views held by the Finnish populace in relation to space tourism and sustainability through an empirical study. The data are derived from two surveys: the first gathering Finnish public opinion on space tourism’s sustainability with the use of principal component analysis; the second utilising a professional Delphi panel for qualitative explanations. The findings, analysed using grounded theory, can be compressed into four dimensions–“virtual travel”, “comparative fairness”, “technological innovations” and “ecopolitics”–through which actions towards sustainability in space tourism might be enhanced in different national planning strategies.},
