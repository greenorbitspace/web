        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Why Space Sustainability Matters</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 text-lg text-white">Space activities are accelerating — driving advances in climate monitoring, global connectivity, and innovation. But rapid growth brings challenges: orbital debris, environmental impacts, and pressure on planetary boundaries. At Green Orbit, we approach sustainability through a <strong>holistic lens</strong> — ensuring that space continues to deliver benefits without crossing ecological or orbital tipping points.</p>

        <p class="mb-6 text-white"><em>Although ‘space sustainability’ is now widely used, until recently, there was no shared definition across the sector.</em></p>

          <p class="italic">“The long-term sustainability of outer space activities is defined as the ability to maintain the conduct of space activities indefinitely into the future in a manner that realizes the objectives of equitable access to the benefits of the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes, in order to meet the needs of the present generations while preserving the outer space environment for future generations.”</p>

          <p class="italic">“The long-term sustainability of outer space activities (on-ground and in-orbit) is defined as the ability to maintain and improve the conduct of space activities indefinitely into the future in a manner that ensures continued access to the benefits of the exploration and use of space for peaceful purposes, in order to meet the needs of the present generations while preserving both the Earth and the outer space environment for future generations. Space sustainability also requires promoting the use and environmental benefits of space data and recognising the need for the launch and in-orbit activities to be carried out in an increasingly responsible and sustainable manner.”</p>
