        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Sustainable Practices for Terrestrial Impacts</h2>
        <p class="text-white text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Space missions start on Earth, and the environmental footprint of launch vehicles, manufacturing, and ground operations can be significant. Rocket emissions, material production, and re-entry events contribute to greenhouse gases, chemical pollution, and resource depletion. Minimising these impacts is critical for achieving net-zero goals and respecting planetary boundaries.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Green Orbit works with space operators, manufacturers, and launch providers to implement sustainable practices across the entire value chain, reducing environmental harm while maintaining operational performance.
        </p>

        <Callout title="Key Insight" class="my-6 text-secondary-500">
          Life-cycle assessments show that satellite production and launch can account for up to 90% of the mission’s total carbon footprint.

      <div class="container mx-auto max-w-5xl px-4">
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Key Practices for Minimising Earth Impact</h2>
        <p class="text-white text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Sustainable launches involve optimising fuel use, reducing emissions, and selecting environmentally conscious propellants. Satellite manufacturing can leverage **recycled and low-impact materials**, modular design, and energy-efficient production processes. Responsible disposal strategies and controlled re-entry ensure minimal environmental disruption.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Organisations can also adopt circular economy principles, designing for reuse, refurbishment, and end-of-life recycling. Green Orbit guides clients in implementing these strategies, ensuring measurable reductions in environmental footprint without compromising mission objectives.
