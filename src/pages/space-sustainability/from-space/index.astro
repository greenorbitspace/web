      <div class="container mx-auto max-w-5xl px-4">
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Harnessing Space Data for Global Challenges</h2>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Satellites orbiting the Earth capture critical datasets that are impossible to obtain from the ground. From monitoring deforestation and ocean health to mapping urban growth and agricultural productivity, these observations inform global efforts to manage natural resources and reduce environmental risks.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          At Green Orbit, we specialise in transforming raw satellite data into actionable insights. Our approach enables governments, NGOs, and businesses to identify environmental risks, optimise operations, and design interventions aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

        <p class="my-6 px-4 py-3 bg-primary-600 text-white rounded-md font-semibold">
          Key Insight: 90% of environmental monitoring datasets used in disaster preparedness rely on satellite imagery.

    <!-- Applications Across Sectors -->

      <div class="container mx-auto max-w-5xl px-4">
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Applications Across Sectors</h2>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Space data informs decisions across climate science, agriculture, energy, and urban planning. Earth observation satellites detect greenhouse gas concentrations and track climate anomalies. Remote sensing supports precision agriculture, allowing farmers to monitor crop health, optimise irrigation, and predict yields.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          In the energy sector, satellite data maps renewable potential and monitors grid resilience. Urban planners use geospatial intelligence to optimise land use, manage infrastructure, and improve disaster preparedness. Each of these applications is underpinned by accurate, timely, and verifiable satellite observations.
