    <section title="Why Digital Sustainability Matters">
      <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Energy Demand:</strong> Data centres already account for ~1–2% of global electricity consumption, with demand rising sharply.</li>

        <li><strong>Resource Use:</strong> Hardware production requires rare earth minerals and intensive supply chains.</li>
        <li><strong>Reputation & Compliance:</strong> Organisations face increasing pressure to adopt responsible digital practices.</li>
      </ul>
