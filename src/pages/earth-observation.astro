        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Why Earth Observation Matters</h2>
        <p class="text-white text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Earth observation satellites provide continuous, high-resolution data that is impossible to capture solely from ground-based measurements. These datasets allow governments, NGOs, and businesses to track climate change, monitor natural resources, and manage urban and agricultural development with unprecedented precision.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          From mapping deforestation to assessing water scarcity, Earth observation is a critical tool for informed decision-making and evidence-based policy. It supports disaster preparedness, biodiversity protection, and sustainable urban planning, ensuring that interventions are timely, effective, and impactful.
        </p>

        <Callout title="Key Insight" class="my-6 text-secondary-500">
          Over 70% of climate adaptation strategies worldwide incorporate Earth observation data for planning and monitoring.
