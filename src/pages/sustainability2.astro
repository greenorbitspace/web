        <p>
          At Green Orbit Digital, sustainability is not just a goal — it is embedded in everything we do.
          We are committed to walking the talk by integrating sustainable principles into our operations, strategies, 
          and client services to build trust and demonstrate integrity in the space sector.

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Our Sustainability Commitment</h2>
        <p>
          Sustainability is a guiding principle and a central focus for our agency. From reducing the environmental impact 
          of digital marketing campaigns to promoting responsible innovation in the space ecosystem, we embed sustainability 
          into the very fabric of our work.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          As a purpose-driven agency, we strive to be leaders in sustainable marketing by applying best practices that align 
          with global frameworks like the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement.

          to the content we create. We aim to help our clients communicate their sustainability impact authentically 
          while reducing their marketing footprint.
