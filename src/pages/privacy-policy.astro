      <h2>5. How Long We Keep Your Information</h2>
      <p>
        We retain personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this policy. Once these purposes are met, data is deleted or anonymised.

      </p>

      <h2>7. Your Privacy Rights</h2>
      <p>
        If you are based in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, you have the right to access, correct, or delete personal data we hold about you. You can contact your local data protection authority to lodge a complaint:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm" target="_blank">EEA and UK authorities</a></li>

      <h2>8. Controls for Do-Not-Track Features</h2>
      <p>
        Some browsers and mobile systems offer a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) setting. Currently, there is no standard for recognising DNT signals, so we do not respond to them. If a standard emerges in the future, we will update our practices accordingly.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Updates to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this privacy notice periodically. Where practical, we will notify users of material changes.
