Green Orbit Digital is proud to announce its participation in the Space 18th SDG Coalition’s second annual workshop, taking place on 19 September 2024 at the United Nations Plaza in New York and online. As one of 94 space-stakeholder organisations united under this coalition, we are thrilled to contribute to global discussions on the critical role of space in building a sustainable and peaceful future.

The hybrid event, which marks the lead-up to World Space Week, will gather industry leaders, space development experts, and policy influencers to address the significance of civilian-led space initiatives in advancing sustainable development goals. A key focus of this year’s workshop is the proposed 18th SDG, dedicated to sustainable space development, a theme closely aligned with Green Orbit Digital’s mission to promote eco-conscious ventures in the space sector.

## Green Orbit Digital at the Forefront of Space Sustainability

Ryan Laird, Director of Green Orbit Digital, will speak as part of the prestigious “Space Symposium for the Future” session, moderated by Adriano V. Autino, Founder of Space Renaissance International (SRI). Ryan’s talk, titled “Engaging Stakeholders in Sustainable Space Development for a Resilient Future,” will delve into strategies for fostering robust stakeholder engagement aligned with both the U.N. 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Space 2030 Agenda.

Ryan will explore the unique challenges and opportunities of involving diverse actors—governments, private enterprises, NGOs, and the general public—in the narrative of space as a frontier for sustainable economic and social growth. His presentation will highlight best practices in sustainable marketing, focusing on crafting compelling narratives that resonate across different sectors and cultures. Emphasising transparency, inclusivity, and ethical considerations, Ryan will discuss how these elements build trust and secure long-term commitment from stakeholders.

The talk will also address the role of education and awareness in bridging knowledge gaps, fostering a sense of shared purpose, and promoting the idea of space development as a key driver of global sustainability. By effectively engaging stakeholders, we can ensure that the expansion into the cislunar economy and beyond is not only technologically and economically viable but also socially and environmentally sustainable.

## Key Sessions and Highlights

The workshop will feature two core sessions:

1. Space Symposium for the Future (9:00 AM US EDT): Bringing together keynote speakers from organisations such as The Mars Society, the Human Space Program, and the Lifeboat Foundation, the session will explore the potential of space development in driving global progress.

1. Space Workshop for the Future (2:30 PM US EDT): Facilitated by Robert S. Katz of the World Innovation Network (WIN), this interactive segment will feature five focused tracks covering key areas such as the Space 2030 Agenda, Space for Peace, Economic and Social Growth, Young Generations in Space, and Earth’s Sustainability.

## Looking Ahead: The Space for the Future Report

The outcomes of this event will feed into the final Space for the Future report, set to be released on 10 October 2024. The report will provide actionable recommendations to inform the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Space 2030 Agenda, addressing the need for coordinated efforts to integrate space technology into sustainable development frameworks.

Green Orbit Digital is excited to engage in these vital conversations, furthering our mission of embedding sustainability into the heart of space ventures. We invite all stakeholders to join us in-person or virtually, as we work towards a future where space development serves as a pillar of sustainability and peace for our planet and beyond.
