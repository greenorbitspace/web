Green Orbit Digital is thrilled to announce our dedication to sustainability by endorsing the Sustainable Web Manifesto. This manifesto, a public declaration of our shared commitment to creating a sustainable internet, underscores the vital importance of reducing the environmental impact of digital activities.

In today’s digital-centric world, it’s crucial to acknowledge the significant carbon footprint associated with online operations.

 Study by Freitag et al. 2021.

This underscores the urgent need for sustainable practices in the digital sphere.

We all share and utilise the web, much like we all inhabit and rely on this planet,” remarked Ryan Laird, Director at Green Orbit Digital.“By endorsing the Sustainable Web Manifesto, we’re publicly committing to prioritising sustainability in our digital endeavours and contributing to a greener, more sustainable future.”

The Sustainable Web Manifesto outlines five key principles that signatories pledge to uphold:
