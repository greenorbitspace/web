We’re thrilled to announce that Green Orbit Digital will be attending the upcoming Space-Comm Expo, the premier event that brings together the entire spectrum of space, aerospace, defence, and technology industries. Scheduled for 6th and 7th March 2024, this expo promises two days of immersive experiences, knowledge-sharing, and unparalleled networking opportunities at the heart of the UK’s flourishing space sector.

## Where Space Meets Business

Space-Comm Expo serves as the epicenter for businesses involved in the entire space supply chain, catering to commercial enterprises, government bodies, and defence organisations. As advocates for sustainability and innovation, Green Orbit Digital is eager to engage with industry leaders, visionaries, and professionals to explore the limitless possibilities of the commercial future of space.

## The UK’s Soaring Influence

According to the ADS Group’s Space Outlook 2023, the UK’s space industry continues to ascend, with a turnover of £17.5 billion in 2022, contributing significantly to the nation’s economy. With space exports valued at £5.9 billion in 2022, the UK is swiftly becoming a major player in the international space market. The government’s ambitious goal to grow the sector to 10% by 2030 underscores the importance of events like Space-Comm Expo in driving this growth.
