Green Orbit Digital is proud to announce its accreditation by the Good Business Charter (GBC), joining an esteemed list of organisations, including Aviva, TSB, and Schroders Personal Wealth, recognised for their commitment to responsible business practices.

The Good Business Charter is a straightforward yet impactful accreditation open to UK businesses, charities, and public sector organisations of all sizes. It evaluates organisations against 10 core commitments designed to champion ethical behaviour, foster employee well-being, promote environmental responsibility, and ensure fair treatment of customers and suppliers.

Accreditation reflects adherence to the following 10 principles:

The 10 components of the Good Business Charter.

Achieving GBC accreditation confirms that Green Orbit Digital’s practices align with these values, reinforcing its position as a socially and environmentally conscious leader in the marketing sector.

### Building Trust Through Responsible Business Practices

In today’s business landscape, customers and employees increasingly seek organisations that go beyond profit-driven goals to prioritise ethical and sustainable practices. The Good Business Charter provides a unified framework for businesses to demonstrate accountability, building trust and inspiring others to raise their standards.

Simon Fox, Chairman of the GBC Board, explained:

> 
“The Good Business Charter brings together 10 standards that, although well-established individually, are now unified under one coherent accreditation. This integration provides businesses with a clear benchmark and has the potential to transform business practices for the better.”


### A Commitment to Sustainability and Integrity

Ryan Laird, Director of Green Orbit Digital, shared his enthusiasm:

By prioritising employee well-being, ethical sourcing, and environmental responsibility, the company builds trust and contributes to a more sustainable future. The accreditation also demonstrates to clients and collaborators that they are partnering with a business that genuinely values transparency and accountability.
