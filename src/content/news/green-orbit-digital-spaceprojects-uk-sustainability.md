Green Orbit Digital is pleased to announce a new partnership with SpaceProjects.uk to offer an exciting opportunity for students to engage in a project focused on overcoming communication barriers in the space industry’s sustainability efforts.

This collaboration provides third-year, fourth-year, and Master’s students the chance to contribute remotely to the strategic development of communications within the space sector. The project, titled “Communicating Sustainability – Overcoming Barriers to Implementation in the Space Industry,” aims to explore how space companies can better position their sustainability efforts and improve engagement with key stakeholders, such as policymakers, investors, and the public.

### What is SpaceProjects.uk?

SpaceProjects.uk is a platform operated by UKSEDS (UK Students for the Exploration and Development of Space) and the Space Universities Network (SUN). It matches students in their final or penultimate years with space organisations for remote project work. This initiative gives students the opportunity to work on space-related projects, helping them gain practical experience and industry insights.

UKSEDS is the UK’s national student space society, supporting students and young professionals for over 30 years by running events, providing resources, and teaching new skills. UKSEDS alumni work throughout the global space sector in government, industry, and academia.

Space Universities Network (SUN) enhances the quality of learning and teaching in space science and engineering, helping to create a skilled workforce capable of meeting the challenges of future space exploration.

### How to Apply

Applications for this exciting project are made via SpaceProjects.uk, the platform designed to connect students with space organisations. If you are in your final or penultimate year and interested in taking part in this unique opportunity, you must apply through SpaceProjects.uk by Friday 28ᵗʰ March 2025 (23:59).

To submit your application, visit SpaceProjects.uk and follow the instructions for applying. Please ensure you have a conversation with your university about the scope of the project to ensure it meets your academic requirements before applying.

### What are the benefits?

This collaboration offers students much more than a typical academic project. By participating, students will:

- Gain practical experience working on a real-world project.

- Develop new skills by collaborating with a professional organisation.

- Strengthen their professional profile with hands-on industry experience.

- Explore job insights into potential career paths in the space sector.

### Project Overview

Green Orbit Digital is offering an exciting opportunity for students to contribute to a project aimed at overcoming communication barriers in the space industry’s sustainability efforts. This project focuses on helping space companies improve how they communicate their sustainability initiatives to key stakeholders, such as policymakers, investors, and the general public. While the space sector has made significant strides in prioritising sustainability, many companies still struggle to effectively communicate their efforts, which can lead to missed investment opportunities and slower policy adoption.

Students will be involved in research and analysis to identify common barriers to sustainability adoption in the space sector. They will assist in developing a strategic communication framework and tailored messaging strategies that resonate with different stakeholders. Additionally, students will evaluate communication channels and create actionable guidelines to help space companies build trust and drive greater industry-wide adoption of sustainable practices.

This project will provide students with valuable insight into how space companies can better position their sustainability efforts, as well as hands-on experience in crafting effective communication strategies that address complex environmental issues within the space sector.

### Selection Process

SpaceProjects.uk will conduct an initial selection based on applicants’ initiative and suitability for the project. Green Orbit Digital will then conduct the final selection, identifying students who are best equipped to contribute to the project’s goals.
