This International Day of Persons with Disabilities (IDPWD), Green Orbit Digital is proud to announce its commitment to the Disability Confident scheme, reinforcing our dedication to creating an inclusive and accessible workplace for all.

Aligned with our policies on Equal Opportunities and Equality, Diversity and Inclusion, this pledge represents a step forward in our mission to break down barriers and ensure that our workplace and activities are welcoming to individuals of all abilities. By embracing the principles of Disability Confident, Green Orbit Digital is taking proactive steps to foster diversity and inclusion as core elements of our operations.

“As a Disability Confident Committed Employer, we are dedicated to creating an environment where everyone has the opportunity to thrive,” says Ryan Laird, Director at Green Orbit Digital. “This isn’t just about fulfilling a commitment—it’s about valuing the unique contributions that people with disabilities bring to our organisation and society as a whole.”

## Promoting Accessibility and Inclusion

Globally, over one billion people, or 15% of the population, live with disabilities. In the UK, one in five working-age adults has a disability or long-term health condition, highlighting the importance of equitable access to employment opportunities and inclusive practices.

Green Orbit Digital’s participation in the Disability Confident scheme focuses on:

- Accessible Recruitment Practices: Actively attracting and supporting disabled talent during the hiring process.

- Inclusive Workplaces: Providing reasonable adjustments and tailored support to enable employees with disabilities to succeed.

- Education and Advocacy: Raising awareness among staff to foster understanding and promote inclusive attitudes.

- Accessible Activities: Ensuring our services and initiatives are open and available to all.

## A Commitment to Equality

Green Orbit Digital’s pledge to Disability Confident and our ongoing efforts to enhance accessibility reflect a broader commitment to integrating social responsibility into every aspect of our work. As we mark IDPWD, we reaffirm our belief that diversity strengthens innovation and drives meaningful change.
