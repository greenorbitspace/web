# Championing Sustainability at #OceanHack4EU

Green Orbit Digital is proud to participate in the prestigious #OceanHack4EU hackathon. Our involvement underscores our dedication to leveraging technology and creativity to address critical environmental challenges. This year, we bring forward the idea of Ocean Explorer—a unique fusion of cutting-edge digital tools and sustainability-focused education.

## Embracing Innovation and Sustainability

At Green Orbit Digital, we believe that effective marketing goes beyond promoting products; it entails championing causes that matter. Our participation in #OceanHack4EU aligns perfectly with our mission to foster a sustainable future through innovative digital solutions. Ocean Explorer epitomises this mission, aiming to bridge the gap between oceanic science and public awareness.

## The Importance of the Ocean

We all know the ocean’s central role in our lives and how much humanity depends on its good health. However, we are still learning about it: 95% of it is still unexplored, and new organisms are regularly being discovered. The oceans are not just vast bodies of water but crucial ecosystems supporting life on our planet. The ocean provides food and is a climate regulator, absorbing 25% of our CO2 emissions and 90% of surplus heat from global warming. While the ocean plays a crucial role in the lives of many communities and offers numerous opportunities, it faces threats from climate change and increasing pressures stemming from human activities. These factors affect the health and resilience of marine environments and biodiversity.

## Ocean Explorer: A Vision for the Future

It’s time to act. That’s why we’re joining #OceanHack4EU, a hackathon to find data-driven solutions to these challenges. Join us as we dive deep into innovation and emerge with prototypes that can make a real difference. Let’s protect our oceans and unlock their potential together. The #OceanHack4EU online hackathon is organised by Mercator Ocean International, an implementer of the EU Copernicus Marine Service, on behalf of the European Commission and carried out by Garage48. During this #OceanHack4EU, the participants are invited to use data and information from the EU’s Copernicus Marine Service to tackle the challenge they want. Other EU marine data providers EMODnet and EUMETSAT, data partners of the event, will support the teams.

This event echoes Mercator Ocean International’s mission towards global ocean knowledge for a sustainable ocean aligned with the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development vision. It also reflects the aim of the EU Mission “Restore our Ocean and waters” to protect and restore the health of our ocean and waters through research and innovation, citizen engagement, and blue investments.

Ocean Explorer is designed to inspire a deeper connection with the ocean and promote marine conservation through interactive and engaging educational resources. By harnessing the power of Copernicus Marine Service data, our project provides real-time insights into ocean health, climate impacts, and marine biodiversity.

## Key Features of Ocean Explorer:

1. Interactive Educational Apps: These apps offer virtual tours of marine ecosystems, allowing users to explore the wonders of the ocean from their devices. Interactive maps and simulations bring oceanographic data to life, making learning both fun and informative.

1. Outreach Programmes: Tailored community programmes utilise Copernicus data to highlight the importance of ocean conservation. Workshops and seminars aim to educate and inspire communities to take action.

1. Interactive Learning Materials: We develop multimedia resources, hands-on activities, and online tools that explain critical oceanic processes like acidification, coral bleaching, and pollution. These materials are designed to be accessible and engaging for all age groups.

1. Citizen Science Initiatives: Ocean Explorer empowers citizens to contribute to marine research by providing platforms for data collection and analysis. This initiative not only enhances scientific research but also fosters a sense of community and responsibility.

1. Artistic Collaborations: By partnering with artists, we aim to create visually compelling art inspired by ocean data. These artworks serve as powerful tools to raise awareness and evoke emotional connections to marine conservation.

## Merging Marketing Expertise with Environmental Advocacy

Our extensive experience in digital marketing enables us to effectively promote Ocean Explorer and maximise its reach. We employ targeted campaigns, social media strategies, and compelling storytelling to engage diverse audiences and drive home the message of marine conservation. Our goal is to ensure that Ocean Explorer not only educates but also motivates individuals and communities to become active stewards of the ocean.

## Impact and Vision

Ocean Explorer has the potential to transform how people perceive and interact with the ocean. By making oceanic data accessible and engaging, we aim to cultivate a generation that values and protects marine environments. Our project’s success will be measured by its ability to inspire behavioural change, enhance community engagement, and support scientific research.
