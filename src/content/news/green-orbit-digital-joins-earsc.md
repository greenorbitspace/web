Green Orbit Digital is proud to announce its membership of the European Association of Remote Sensing Companies (EARSC). This membership underscores the company’s commitment to advancing the use of EO data to drive sustainability initiatives across various sectors.

EARSC serves as a vital hub for companies engaged in delivering EO-derived geo-information services, fostering collaboration between industry stakeholders, decision-makers, and end-users. By joining EARSC, Green Orbit Digital aims to amplify its efforts in promoting the manifold benefits of EO data in addressing pressing global challenges related to environmental monitoring, sustainable development, disaster risk management, space applications, and telecommunications.

“We are thrilled to become a member of EARSC and contribute to the collective efforts aimed at harnessing the power of Earth observation for the greater good,” said Ryan Laird, Director at Green Orbit Digital. “Through our membership with EARSC, we seek to elevate awareness about the transformative potential of EO data in driving sustainability initiatives worldwide.”

The Earth observation sector plays a pivotal role in delivering a wide range of social, environmental, and economic benefits to communities worldwide. EARSC leads initiatives such as the Sentinel Benefits Study (SeBS), which measures the total societal impact of products and services derived from Sentinel satellite data. Through this project, EARSC demonstrates the significant value that EO data brings to various stakeholders across the value chain, from primary users to citizens and society as a whole.
