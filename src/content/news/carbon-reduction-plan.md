Based on Green Orbit Digital's existing Carbon Reduction Plan, here are key areas that could be enhanced:

- Accelerate Net Zero Timeline: While the current plan aims for Net Zero by 2050, there's already a stretch target of 2040. Consider making 2040 the primary target given the company's small operational footprint as a remote-working business.

- Strengthen Digital Sustainability:

- Expand Scope 3 Initiatives: Focus on reducing the main sources of Scope 3 emissions:

- Set Clear Interim Targets:

- Enhance Partnerships: Leverage participation in Race to Zero to develop new sustainable initiatives and collaborate on climate action campaigns

The plan should be reviewed and updated annually to ensure compliance with standards and track progress.
