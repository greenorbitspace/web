We are excited to announce that Green Orbit Digital has been selected to present at the Environmental Justice in Space (EJiS) Workshop, hosted by the JustSpace Alliance. Our abstract, titled “Communicating Space Sustainability: PR, ESG, and the Space Debris Challenge,“ has been accepted for inclusion in this event. Our director, Ryan Laird, will also be participating in the Q&A: The Orbital Environment on 20 June 2024 at 11:00am-12:00pm EDT (4:00pm-5:00pm BST or 5:00pm-6:00pm CEST).

As human activity in space continues to expand, so too does the risk of damaging the space environment, much like we have damaged our environment here on Earth. The EJiS Workshop aims to address questions of environmental justice in space, exploring how to equitably distribute both the benefits and the costs of our use of the space environment.

Our presentation will focus on the importance of effective communication in promoting space sustainability. We will delve into the role of public relations (PR) strategies, Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles, and the challenges posed by space debris. By drawing parallels with environmental justice movements on Earth, we aim to glean valuable insights for developing a sustainable and just relationship with the natural environment beyond our atmosphere. 

The workshop will provide a unique opportunity for space experts, environmental justice activists, and researchers to come together and exchange ideas. Through pre-recorded talks, live Q&A sessions, and panel discussions, participants will explore areas of concern in the space environment, learn from the history of environmental justice movements on Earth, and brainstorm ideas for ensuring an equitable and sustainable future for humanity in space.

Given the virtual format of the workshop, attendees from around the globe will have the chance to engage with the content and contribute to the conversation. We look forward to sharing our insights and learning from our fellow participants as we collectively strive towards a more sustainable and just approach to space exploration and utilisation.
