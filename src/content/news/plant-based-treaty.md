In a landmark commitment to environmental responsibility, Green Orbit Digital has proudly endorsed the Plant Based Treaty, aligning with its mission to drive eco-conscious innovation in the space industry. This endorsement represents a firm stand against environmental degradation and an embrace of sustainable practices both within and beyond the company’s digital marketing services.

## Why the Plant Based Treaty?

The Plant Based Treaty is a bold initiative designed to complement the Paris Agreement by addressing the climate impacts of food systems. It places animal agriculture at the centre of the climate conversation, advocating a global shift toward plant-based diets as a pathway to protect ecosystems, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and promote food security worldwide. By endorsing the Treaty, Green Orbit Digital joins a growing network of individuals, organisations, and cities advocating for systemic change that prioritises the planet’s health.

“We believe that as an organisation shaping narratives in the space industry, we have an important role to play in promoting sustainability. Endorsing the Plant Based Treaty aligns with our values and demonstrates our commitment to advocating for greener futures—not only in space but here on Earth.” – said Ryan Laird, Director of Green Orbit Digital.


## A Plan of Action: Workshops and Events to Promote Plant-Based Principles

Green Orbit Digital’s endorsement of the Plant Based Treaty is just the beginning. The agency is organising a series of workshops and events designed to educate, inspire, and activate sustainable practices in the space sector. These events will aim to:

- Promote Awareness: Green Orbit Digital will host virtual and in-person webinars, bringing experts to discuss the links between food systems, climate change, and sustainable business. These sessions will also address how plant-based solutions can contribute to global sustainability.

- Educate on Practical Implementation: In collaboration with environmental NGOs, Green Orbit Digital will facilitate workshops to introduce the principles of the Treaty, offering practical insights into shifting organisational practices toward plant-based policies, reducing emissions, and promoting sustainable food systems.

- Integrate Plant-Based Principles into Business Strategy: Specialised sessions will guide companies in the space industry on how they can integrate plant-based principles in their operations, catering options, and employee engagement programmes.

## Core Principles of the Treaty

Green Orbit Digital’s initiatives will focus on three main principles, mirroring the Treaty’s key demands:

1. Redirect: These efforts will work to eliminate the underlying causes of climate damage by encouraging a transition to plant-based systems. Green Orbit Digital will advocate for plant-based alternatives within their clients’ and partners’ operations and is developing informational campaigns on the environmental benefits of a plant-based approach.

1. Relinquish: This principle calls for halting the expansion of harmful practices like deforestation for animal agriculture. Green Orbit Digital aims to influence public discourse by promoting responsible consumption, production, and urban greening projects. Partnering with cities, they will support green initiatives aimed at increasing green spaces, wildlife corridors, and local plant-based food systems.

1. Restore: This principle seeks active ecological restoration. Green Orbit Digital will sponsor community rewilding and reforestation projects, aligning with Treaty goals of replanting critical ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity, and supporting rewilding efforts in communities. These projects will aim to create green oases in urban areas, as well as offering grants for local communities to establish sustainable food gardens.

## Building a Global Movement in the Space Sector

By adopting the Plant Based Treaty’s goals and weaving them into its ethos, Green Orbit Digital is taking a leadership role in sustainable transformation within the space industry. This endorsement not only signals a commitment to responsible stewardship but also encourages others within the sector to embrace plant-based solutions as a vital element of the climate solution.

In the words of Oxford University researcher Joseph Poore, “A vegan diet is probably the single biggest way to reduce your impact on planet Earth.” Green Orbit Digital’s endorsement of the Plant Based Treaty reflects this wisdom, showing how organisations can be leaders in reducing climate impacts.

As Green Orbit Digital embarks on this path, it invites other space industry leaders to join the movement, furthering the cause of a sustainable planet that can thrive alongside human innovation.
