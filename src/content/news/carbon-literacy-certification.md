We’re proud to share that the **Green Orbit Digital team has officially completed Carbon Literacy Training**, delivered as part of the **Greener Future Leicestershire** initiative for businesses across Leicester and Leicestershire.

The fully funded, in-person programme—developed and delivered by the **University of Leicester School of Business**—was designed to empower local SMEs to take meaningful climate action. Packed with practical insights, lively discussions, and collaborative workshops, the day provided both a grounding in climate science and a clear path toward building actionable carbon reduction plans.


### **What the Training Covered**

Participants explored the latest climate science, national policy and legislation, and the measurable business benefits of carbon reduction. The course culminated in each participant achieving **official Carbon Literacy certification**, recognised by the **Carbon Literacy Project**, which equips individuals and organisations with the knowledge and motivation to reduce their carbon footprint.

Typical emissions savings of 5–15% per participant demonstrate that Carbon Literacy isn’t just about learning — it’s about measurable impact. Businesses emerge not only better informed, but ready to take practical steps toward **Net Zero growth** and improved resource efficiency.


### **A Natural Fit for Green Orbit Digital**

For Green Orbit Digital, the training directly supports our ongoing mission: to make sustainability strategic, measurable, and actionable through digital innovation. As a marketing agency working at the intersection of **space, sustainability, and digital transformation**, understanding the carbon implications of digital operations is fundamental to our work.

This training reinforces our ability to:

- **Assess and reduce** the carbon footprint of digital tools, data infrastructure, and campaign delivery.
- **Support clients** in integrating sustainability into their brand and communications strategies.
- **Advise on low-impact digital marketing**, including energy-efficient web performance and responsible content delivery.
- **Bridge science and storytelling**, translating data on carbon impact into engaging, transparent narratives that inspire action.

> “Becoming Carbon Literate strengthens how we deliver on our values,” said Ryan Laird, Director of Green Orbit Digital.

> “Sustainability isn’t a trend—it’s a foundation for smarter business. This training helps us and our clients take measurable steps towards climate-positive growth, using data and creativity to drive genuine change.”

### **Why Carbon Literacy Matters**

The **IPCC’s AR6 Synthesis Report** highlights that limiting global warming to safe levels requires immediate, deep, and sustained reductions in carbon emissions. Yet, many businesses—particularly SMEs—still face barriers to action, from lack of understanding to limited resources.

That’s where Carbon Literacy makes a difference. It bridges the gap between **awareness and implementation**, helping teams understand how everyday business activities contribute to emissions and how simple shifts in behaviour, procurement, and communication can deliver real carbon savings.

As part of the wider **Greener Future Leicestershire** project, this initiative is helping to create a more climate-aware business ecosystem across the region—one where sustainability drives innovation and competitiveness.


### **Looking Ahead**

Green Orbit Digital is now applying these insights across our operations and client work, embedding Carbon Literacy principles into our sustainability audits, campaign strategies, and data reporting frameworks.

Our next step is to continue sharing what we’ve learned—helping clients, partners, and the wider space and tech sectors align business growth with environmental responsibility.

Because becoming Carbon Literate isn’t just about understanding the problem—it’s about leading the solutions.
