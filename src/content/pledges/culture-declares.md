logo: "/logos/pledges/culture-declares.png"
values: 
  - environmental justice
  - collaboration
  - resilience
  - systemic change
how: "We declare that the Earth’s life-supporting systems are in collapse, threatening biodiversity and human societies everywhere. Alive to the beauty of our planet, we challenge power structures that disregard science, silence marginalised voices, and perpetuate ecocide. Through creative campaigns, partnerships, and advocacy, we amplify climate-positive innovations in the space sector, support cross-sector collaboration, and inspire communities to adapt, thrive, and safeguard biodiversity."
why: "The science is clear – there is only a 5% chance of keeping global heating below 2°C. The Paris Agreement is failing to deliver the scale of change needed, while climate and ecological breakdown accelerate. Three species vanish every hour; ice sheets destabilise; extreme weather, rising seas, and resource conflicts threaten lives. Those least responsible are most affected. We declare to demand urgent, just, and systemic transformation, aligning with the UN Sustainable Development Goals to protect the planet for present and future generations."
