name: "Space Industry Statement in Support of International Commitments to Not Conduct ASAT Tests"
description: "Our growing reliance on commercial space services—such as communication, navigation, and Earth observation—is threatened by anti-satellite (ASAT) weapon tests that create hazardous orbital debris. This endangers space safety, sustainability, and future economic activities in low Earth orbit. In December 2023, the UN General Assembly adopted resolution 77/41 urging countries to commit to halting such tests."
