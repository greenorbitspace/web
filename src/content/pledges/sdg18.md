name: "SDG18"
description: "Only by expanding the domain of life into space can we fulfill the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) on Earth in the long term. The Space Renaissance International and the National Space Society, alongside numerous space organizations, urge UN COPUOS State Parties to adopt a resolution establishing an 18th Sustainable Development Goal (SDG18). This goal calls for the sustainable expansion of human and community life into space to ensure universal and sustainable development for humanity, all life forms, and the life support environment — both on Earth and beyond."

Our efforts include engaging key stakeholders, facilitating research on the socio-environmental implications of space colonization, and raising global awareness about the necessity of extending sustainable development beyond Earth. Additionally, we collaborate with global space organizations to ensure exploration and expansion efforts align with ethical and sustainability principles."
why: "We support the establishment of SDG18 because the long-term sustainability of humanity and life on Earth depends on expanding our presence into space.
