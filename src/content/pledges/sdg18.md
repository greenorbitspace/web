Additionally, we collaborate with international space organizations to ensure that space exploration and development are conducted responsibly and sustainably."
why: "We support the Space 18th Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) because it represents a critical step towards ensuring the long-term sustainability of life on Earth and beyond.
