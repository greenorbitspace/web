**UN Sustainable Transport Day 2025** highlights the importance of creating transport systems that are sustainable, efficient, and inclusive. Across the UK, cities are exploring how low-carbon solutions, data-driven insights, and community engagement can transform mobility. Leicester offers a practical example of how these principles can come together, combining innovation, space technology, and effective communication to shape a more sustainable future.

## **The Case for Sustainable Mobility**

Sustainable transport is about more than reducing emissions—it is about improving **quality of life, accessibility, and safety**, while supporting economic growth. Leicester has long championed this approach through its **Local Transport Plans**, aiming to:

- Reduce congestion and carbon emissions
- Promote walking, cycling, and public transport
- Improve air quality and public health
- Ensure equitable access to mobility for all residents

By 2026, the forthcoming **Local Transport Plan 4 (LTP4)** will continue to build on these objectives, with a strong focus on **low-carbon and technologically enabled solutions**.

---

## **Electric and Low-Carbon Transport**

Leicester’s ambitions are exemplified by the **Leicester Buses Partnership**, which is working to make bus travel **electric, frequent, reliable, and affordable**. By expanding electric fleets, introducing priority measures, and improving real-time information, the city is setting a model for **urban mobility that balances environmental goals with community needs**.

Sustainable marketing and communications are critical to this effort. At **Green Orbit Digital**, we help cities and organisations **translate these initiatives into clear, engaging narratives** that encourage residents and businesses to adopt low-carbon travel options. Through effective messaging, campaigns, and community outreach, sustainable transport becomes **more visible, trusted, and actionable**.

---

## **Space-Enabled Insights**

Cities like Leicester are increasingly harnessing **space-derived data** to make smarter transport decisions. Local institutions such as **Space Park Leicester, the National Centre for Earth Observation (NCEO), and EarthSense** provide satellite and geospatial insights that inform mobility strategies:

- **Air quality monitoring:** Identifying hotspots to target interventions
- **Traffic analysis:** Optimising routes and public transport scheduling
- **Carbon tracking:** Measuring the environmental impact of transport initiatives

Integrating these insights with communications strategies ensures that the public understands how **data-driven decisions improve daily life**, from cleaner air to reduced congestion.

---

## **Community Engagement and Behaviour Change**

Sustainable transport succeeds only when people **choose it**. Engaging communities through campaigns, storytelling, and education is essential. Green Orbit Digital supports this by:

- Highlighting success stories of local businesses and residents embracing sustainable mobility
- Making complex data accessible and actionable
- Encouraging participation in consultations and local initiatives

By linking **space-enabled insights** to practical, everyday decisions, residents are empowered to make low-carbon choices that collectively drive meaningful change.

---

## **Looking Ahead**

Leicester demonstrates how cities can **combine technology, sustainability, and communications** to transform mobility. UN Sustainable Transport Day reminds us that **smart transport systems rely not just on infrastructure but on engagement, insight, and vision**.

> “Sustainable transport is about more than building infrastructure—it’s about connecting communities, informing decisions with data, and communicating the benefits so everyone can take part.” – Green Orbit Digital
