International Dark Sky Week is a global celebration of the dark and natural night—a time to appreciate the beauty and importance of our unadulterated skies. In a world where artificial light pervades every corner of our existence, the natural darkness of night often goes unnoticed, misunderstood, or even feared. However, the dark sky holds a profound sense of wonder and awe, and it plays a crucial role in the health and wellbeing of our planet.

One of the key aspects of International Dark Sky Week is the emphasis on dark and quiet skies—the kind that are increasingly rare in our modern world. The deployment of tens of thousands of communication satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) represents a remarkable technological achievement. While these satellites provide essential communication services to remote regions, their presence in the night sky has significant implications.

Satellite constellations, due to their low orbit, are visible to the naked eye, particularly at low elevations and during twilight and dawn. This not only impacts stargazing enthusiasts but also poses challenges for professional astronomers. Modern telescopes, designed to detect faint celestial objects, are disrupted by the presence of these satellites, rendering a considerable portion of astronomical observations unusable.

The mitigation of these effects calls for internationally agreed-upon regulations, falling under the purview of organisations like the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS). However, navigating this complex issue requires careful consideration of technical, regulatory, and environmental factors.

Moreover, light pollution exacerbates the challenges posed by satellite constellations. Human-made alterations to outdoor light levels disrupt ecosystems, endangering wildlife such as migratory birds, sea turtles, and mammals. It also impacts human health and wellbeing, wastes energy and money, contributes to climate change, and obscures our view of the universe.

DarkSky International, a leading advocate for dark skies, works tirelessly to restore the nighttime environment and protect communities from the harmful effects of light pollution. Through outreach, advocacy, and conservation efforts, DarkSky International promotes responsible outdoor lighting practices that balance the need for illumination with the preservation of natural darkness.

As we celebrate International Dark Sky Week, let us pause to appreciate the beauty of the natural night sky and recognise its importance to our planet. By embracing dark and quiet skies, and advocating for responsible lighting practices, we can ensure that future generations can continue to marvel at the wonders of the universe while preserving the ecological balance of our world. Together, let us work towards a future where the night sky remains a source of inspiration and wonder for all.
