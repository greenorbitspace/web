### Overview
Environmental Monitoring from space provides global, continuous, and high-resolution data for tracking Earth's systems. Satellites observe atmospheric conditions, land cover, water bodies, forests, urban areas, and pollution patterns to support decision-making and policy.

### Key Applications
- **Climate Change Monitoring:** Track greenhouse gases, ice cover, and temperature changes.
- **Ecosystem Health:** Monitor forests, wetlands, and biodiversity hotspots.
- **Water Resources Management:** Observe rivers, lakes, and reservoirs for water security.
- **Pollution Tracking:** Detect air and water pollution using remote sensing data.
- **Disaster Management:** Support flood, wildfire, and drought monitoring.

### Benefits
- Provides accurate, large-scale environmental data.
- Supports policy-making and sustainable management.
- Enables early detection of environmental threats.
- Facilitates international collaboration on climate and ecological protection.
