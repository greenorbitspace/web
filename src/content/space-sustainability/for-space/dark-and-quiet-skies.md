### Overview
The "Dark and Quiet Skies" theme addresses the growing challenges of light and radio-frequency pollution that interfere with astronomy and Earth observation. Satellites, large constellations, and urban lighting can obscure natural skies, reducing observational quality and impacting ecosystems.

### Key Applications
- **Astronomical Observatories:** Maintaining dark skies for optical and radio telescopes.
- **Satellite Regulations:** Reducing satellite brightness and managing constellation deployments.
- **Environmental Monitoring:** Studying artificial light impact on nocturnal wildlife.
- **Cultural Preservation:** Protecting natural night skies for educational and heritage purposes.

### Benefits
- Enhances scientific observations from Earth and space.
- Supports sustainable space operations.
- Protects nocturnal ecosystems and biodiversity.
- Preserves cultural and educational resources for future generations.
