### Overview
Green Propulsion technologies aim to reduce the environmental impact of satellite and spacecraft operations. Innovations include electric propulsion, non-toxic propellants, and high-efficiency engines that lower emissions and improve mission sustainability.

### Key Applications
- **Satellite Propulsion:** Efficient orbit maintenance and end-of-life deorbiting.
- **Launch Vehicles:** Reducing launch emissions with cleaner fuels.
- **In-Orbit Servicing:** Propulsion for satellite repair and refueling missions.
- **Deep Space Missions:** Sustainable propulsion options for long-duration exploration.

### Benefits
- Minimizes environmental impact of space missions.
- Extends satellite operational life with efficient propulsion.
- Supports global sustainability goals for the space sector.
- Encourages adoption of green technologies across the aerospace industry.
