# Atmosphere

## Air Quality and Atmospheric Composition
- Monitoring pollutants: NO₂, SO₂, CO, PM2.5, PM10
- Greenhouse gas concentrations: CO₂, CH₄, N₂O
- Vertical and horizontal distribution of atmospheric components

## Ozone Layer and Ultra-Violet Radiation
- Ozone layer thickness monitoring
- UV index and exposure risk assessment
- Ozone-depleting substances tracking

## Emissions and Surface Fluxes
- Anthropogenic and natural emissions
- Surface fluxes of greenhouse gases
- Tracking emission hotspots and trends

## Solar Radiation
- Solar irradiance measurements
- UV radiation levels and seasonal variations
- Impact on climate and ecosystems

## Climate Forcing
- Radiative forcing analysis
- Effects of aerosols, clouds, and greenhouse gases
- Human and natural contributions to climate change
