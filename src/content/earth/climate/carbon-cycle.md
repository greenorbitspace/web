# Carbon Cycle

## Atmospheric Carbon
- Monitoring CO₂, CH₄, and other greenhouse gas concentrations
- Seasonal and regional variations
- Sources and sinks tracking

## Oceanic Carbon
- Carbon sequestration in oceans
- Dissolved inorganic carbon and organic carbon cycles
- Ocean acidification and its ecological impacts

## Terrestrial Carbon
- Forests and vegetation as carbon sinks
- Soil carbon storage and fluxes
- Land-use change and its effect on the carbon budget

## Human Impact
- Fossil fuel emissions and industrial contributions
- Carbon budgets and mitigation strategies
- Monitoring effectiveness of carbon reduction policies

## Carbon Cycle Feedbacks
- Interaction between climate change and carbon fluxes
- Positive and negative feedback mechanisms
- Modeling carbon-climate interactions
