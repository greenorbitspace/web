# Greenhouse Gases

## Key Greenhouse Gases
- Carbon dioxide (CO₂)
- Methane (CH₄)
- Nitrous oxide (N₂O)
- Fluorinated gases (HFCs, PFCs, SF₆)

## Sources and Emissions
- Anthropogenic sources: energy, industry, agriculture, transport
- Natural sources: wetlands, oceans, soil respiration
- Emission trends and hotspots

## Atmospheric Monitoring
- Satellite-based greenhouse gas observation
- Ground-based monitoring networks
- Global and regional concentration trends

## Impacts on Climate
- Radiative forcing and global warming potential
- Feedback mechanisms and climate sensitivity
- Interactions with water vapor, clouds, and aerosols

## Mitigation Strategies
- Reducing fossil fuel emissions
- Carbon capture and storage
- Policy frameworks and international agreements (e.g., Paris Agreement)
